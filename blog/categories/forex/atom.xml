"No Secrets" means the secret is know the basics and apply plenty of elbow grease. There are also miscellanous trading truisms that I will add as time passes.</p>

<h1>Technical Catalysts</h1>

<h2>Sam Seiden</h2>

<p><blockquote><p>"Focus On The Lowest Trading Activity"</p></blockquote></p>

<p>When identifying where the next turn in the market will be, most traders focus on where the most trading activity took place on a chart. This is also what everyone is taught to do. I don't. I focus on the opposite, where the least amount of trades took place because this is where supply and demand is most out of balance and that's where prices turn.</p>

<h2>James Chen</h2>

<p><blockquote><p>"Knowing The Strength &amp; Weakness Single Currencies"</p></blockquote></p>

<p>Trading currencies is vastly different from trading other financial instruments. The key differentiator: currencies are traded exclusively as relative, rather than absolute, entities. Although all forex traders should be well aware of this, it warrants further emphasis that currencies are traded in pairs. What this really means is that currencies are not traded in isolation, but rather in terms of their relative values against other currencies.</p>

<p>If the dollar is weak, one should ask what exactly it is weak against. Is it weak across the board, or just against Canadian dollar, or Swiss franc, etc.? Is it strong against euro while weak against yen? When a significant bearish move occurs in EUR/GBP, was it a bearish EUR move, or a bullish GBP move, or both? These are crucial questions that all Forex traders should ask, and answer.</p>

<p>Knowing the strength/weakness statuses of SINGLE currencies, instead of just currency PAIRS, is key to understanding currency pair movements and intercurrency relationships. Pairing strongest currencies against weakest currencies is a highprobability approach. It is essential that traders knows at  all times the relative strengths and/or weaknesses of all the  single currencies that are being considered for potential trades.</p>

<h2>Adam Rosen</h2>

<p><blockquote><p>"Time Of Day : Less Is More..."</p></blockquote></p>

<p>The most significant economic data focuses around a number of basic themes including inflation, employment, growth, or lack thereof. News of this nature is typically released during the first few hours of each respective trading session. As traders react to the news, markets tend to enjoy periods of greater volatility and volume during these morning hours which are commonly known as the "active market hours".</p>

<p><blockquote><p>LON 08001000 GMT<br/>NYC 13001500 GMT<br/>TYO 24000200 GMT</p></blockquote></p>

<p>The EUR/USD (5minute) displayed with the Bollinger Bands indicator clearly shows the most significant trend began and lasted during the first 2hours of the trading day. A 'trendtrader' anticipating a breakout to the upside would have been handsomely rewarded by looking for that 'higherhigh' that did in fact occur early in the UStrading session.</p>

<h2>Cesar B. Leiceaga</h2>

<p><blockquote><p>"Trading with Pivot Points"</p></blockquote></p>

<p>I've found as a determining tool to apply in the foreign exchange markets, both daily and weekly pivot points.Some basic principals first to trading with pivots: They act as support and resistance.</p>

<p>If prices accelerate and hold above its pivot point, market participants will look to buy or turn bullish. If prices trade below a pivot point, traders will be looking to sell or short confirming the sentiment has turned bearish. Rules I apply to trade trends with pivot points</p>

<p><blockquote><p>In Uptrends: Buy dips to the pivot point and add to the position in S1 and S2. Use S3 to place a stop loss order. Use R1,R2, R3 as profit targets.</p></p><p><p>In Downtrends:Sell rallies to the pivot point and add to the position in R1 and R2. Use R3 to place a stop loss order. Use S1,S2 and S3 as profit targets.</p></p><p><p>In Ranges:Range low: Buy in S1 or S2. Stop S3 and target the daily pivot point.Range top: Sell in R1 or R2. Stop in R3 and target the daily pivot point.</p></blockquote></p>

<p>It is important to remember that these techniques applying pivot points best work in liquid pairs or majors: EUR/USD, USD/CHF, USD/JPY and GBP/USD.</p>

<h2>Ross Yamashita</h2>

<p><blockquote><p>"Scan Smarter : Not Harder"</p></blockquote></p>

<p>When studying Elliott Wave or any other wave pattern recognition theory, so many traders put too much emphasis on what the wave count is with regards to the current market.Rather than getting so caught up in where the market is in the count, I scan the markets for only 4 "high probability" patterns : Impulse, Zig Zag, Ending Diagonal and Contracting Triangles.</p>

<p>Certain aspects of these 4 high probability patterns have shown high levels of probable outcomes and they all can be fairly easy to see, even without Elliott Wave indicators or software.I trade primarily 14 currency pairs and I scan all my charts within minutes. Once I see any potential high probability patterns, I then investigate further with more analysis.</p>

<p>I'm not suggesting people should disregard all that Elliott Wave Theory has to offer : as a full understanding will help you in your trading.But ask yourself : Why am I trading?I, for one, enjoy trading and the challenges and excitement that come with it. However, the bottom line is, we're all here to make money. So, put the odds in your favor and search for the high probability patterns</p>

<h2>Valeria Bednarik</h2>

<p><blockquote><p>"Market volume with no technical indicators"</p></blockquote></p>

<p>Determining market volume could be critical when it comes to forex trading, as we understand that technical signals have higher probabilities of success when they come along with the right volume. For example, the break of the neckline of a figure, or a support or resistance level, are always considered reliable if volume is high, while pullbacks to those areas should show a lower volume, to give our signal further support.</p>

<p>However, not everyone realizes that volume indicators tend to be tricky: several of those are just providing information about the volume traded in the broker/platform that we are using to work; they can't measure the volume of the whole market. So how can we easily determine whether there is high or low volume at a certain moment?</p>

<p>The easiest way for me is mostly a visual trick: I turn to my 1 hour chart, or even 30 minutes one, when I see something that could be understood as a break or a sign. If that particular candle is at least twice as long as the average that the pair moves in that particular time frame, I understand there is high volume favoring my signal. For example, if the EUR/USD moves 25 pips per hour on average, the candle that triggers the signal should be at least of 50 pips (double the 25) or more. Easy, clean, and with no extra indicators to mess our trading strategy.</p>

<h1>Fundamental Catalysts</h1>

<h2>Aamar Hussain</h2>

<p><blockquote><p>"Adapt and Overcome"</p></blockquote></p>

<p>Always be willing and ready to adapt to the market. (a) Daily Ranges, (b) Volume and (c) Fundamentals, all provide key information and clues as to which technical analysis and trading strategies will work best in a particular environment. NO strategy or analysis method will work in all environments. If you keep a close eye on the abc and make copious notes and observations how changes in each effect market dynamics you will be able to ascertain which methods and strategies are most suited to each environment.Data and Evolution are Key.</p>

<h2>Charis Charilaou</h2>

<p><blockquote><p>"Focus on the main story... everything else is just noise"</p></blockquote></p>

<p>Markets are constantly moving and media try to publish as much information as possible in order to gain credibility and expand audiences. However, not all information is equal. You need to be able to screen out most of the news and focus on the main story. This is the only way to understand the Market and become efficient in any trading style. There is always a main story concerning a war, a political state, an economical point of view etc. This is what the market focuses on and this is what creates a trend. Everything else is just noise.</p>

<h2>John Kicklighter</h2>

<p><blockquote><p>"Know What Moves Your Trade"</p></blockquote></p>

<p>One of the most valuable lessons I have learned trading in the past few years is to first identify what fundamental driver or drivers the market deems most important for a particular currency or the market as a whole. It's easy to get caught up in reviewing all the economic indicators or headlines that cross the wires and then trying to assess what kind of impact it could have on price action. Yet, if for example yield expectations are the market's sole concern, we shouldn't waste time monitoring growth numbers and potentially confusing an otherwise straightforward forecast. Furthermore, when looking for that primary catalyst, it is important to remember that the market always boils down to the equilibrium of risk and reward in one way or another.</p>

<h2>Dirk Du Toit</h2>

<p><blockquote><p>"You need a fundamental view."</p></blockquote></p>

<p>If you use technical analysis you base your whole trading system on this principle: "The last price contains all information about price valuation".A series of such "last prices" is a pattern and a pattern is predictive of future moves.The problem very short term minded traders experience is that the Big Players as a rule ignore their "last prices". They don't even consider an intra day price as important.It is completely irrelevant to them that that price you think is a high probability indicator exists!</p>

<p>Institutions pay armies of analysts to determine what is the "content of last prices". What have been "factored in" in relation to a house "fundamental view".Institutions do technical analysis under the continuous guidance of a fundamental view.If you know what is really in the price, your technical analysis becomes really predictive because you can judgethe potential action of traders with a larger time horizon and outlook than yours.</p>

<p>Simple technical systems become effective and profitable as part of a proper fundamental view. Ignore the fundamentals at your own risk! (And please, don't confuse economic data releases with the real drivers behind currency prices.)</p>

<h1>Risk Control</h1>

<h2>Elizabeth Gregory</h2>

<p><blockquote><p>"Plan the trade, trade the plan"</p></blockquote></p>

<p>What usually hurts novice traders is poor risk management; choosing wildly optimistic profit targets in order to justify cripplingly painful stops and staying in losing trades far beyond the original plan. It's human nature to take profit on winning positions too early for fear of losing small accrued profits and to hold onto losing positions (and worse, doubling down!) in the vain hope that the market must surely reverse soon.</p>

<p>One of the best ways to enforce good discipline is to ensure that when entering any trade, there are always predetermined stop and take profit orders entered and that the amount of capital you risk is AT LEAST as much as you aim to win.The ONLY adjustments that should be made after that should be to trail the stop tighter (to minimize losses/guarantee profits) while extending the profit target.</p>

<p>Once the action starts, you can be sure the trade will succeed or fail within the reasonable riskreward criteria that was decided with a cool head. What's more, when relying on orders and not staring fixedly at every tick on open positions, trading becomes a much less stressful and emotional experience.</p>

<h2>Alberto Munoz</h2>

<p><blockquote><p>"Risk/Reward Ratio vs Investment Horizon"</p></blockquote></p>

<p>My main discovery about trading in the last months is that risk/reward ratio should be directly proportional to your investment horizon. That is, when you're trading in very short time frames, scalping for a few pips, then you're risk/reward ratio should be low, even lower than 1. The concept behind this is that it makes no sense to hold a position too much time waiting for a profit which is twice the stop loss: it won't work as the market noise will probably hit our tight stop. On the other hand, when trading on higher time frames (i.e. daily) risk/reward ratios should be high, above 2 or more, as we have time enough to reach our target.</p>

<h2>Yohay Elam</h2>

<p><blockquote><p>"Never risk more than 2% of your account at once"</p></blockquote></p>

<p>As with anything new, you're likely to make mistakes, learn from them, and then improve. Many new traders risk too much of their account, and burn it out before learning anything.Money management is the "secret" to avoiding this fate. This abstract idea can go down to the 2% rule. Making 2% an overriding priority means no stop loss movements, using lower leverage, making a bigger initial deposit, having higher spreads, or anything, else that will keep the losses limited. Some things are more comfortable to do than others, but keeping this rule will likely yield in better results for newbies in the long run : keep them away from burning their account.</p>

<h2>Ron Schelling</h2>

<p><blockquote><p>"Never use more than 2% equity risk when I place stops."</p></blockquote></p>

<p>I am in trading since 1983, a time that there was no computer or realtime data, just a phone ! Data came in by telex and I draw the charts by hand, actually the best training I ever got. Today we have almost everything for free, realtime data, online brokerage, realtime charts etc.Still most traders make no money, at least not constant. I am happy to survive it so far and maybe this comes from discipline I learned in aviation to fly aircraft using strictly checklist for each part of the flight.</p>

<p>The best trading tip I can give you and which helped me to survive > 25 years of trading is as follows: "Never use more than 2% equity risk when I place stops."For example, if I have 4 positions and all stopped out, I will lose max. 2% of clients account. So the stop level is important and so the number of contracts .If there is high volatility and a high daily range, than my number of contracts are smaller. If there is low volatility and smaller daily ranges, than my number of contracts are bigger. At any time, being stopped out in all positions, I will lose max. 2% on equity.</p>

<h1>Market Behavior &amp; Psychology</h1>

<h2>Keagan York</h2>

<p><blockquote><p>"Head not Heart!"</p></blockquote></p>

<p>It is always hard to take a loss. However, the first rule that needs to be adhered to by a novice trader is that positions can and will go against you and that stop losses are an important part of any trading strategy. I have been in the position where I have gotten emotionally attached to a position and didn't trade with my head. On occasion, things ended up working out. However, more often than not, I ended up losing more money. In these situations, not only do you lose money but you also end up missing out on better opportunities because your ability to trade is compromised by the funding the losing position. So remember think with your head, not your heart and make the tough call!</p>

<h2>Joseph Trevisani</h2>

<p><blockquote><p>"Be modest in your confidence and thankful in your profits"</p></blockquote></p>

<p>When our trades lose money, whatever our logic, we can be sure we were not alone. But we can equally be sure that we were in the minority. Had we been in the majority the market would have performed as anticipated. The market decision process is that simple. It is a matter of putting our behavior in line with the majority as often as we can. The most effective tool to achieve that is our own empirically tested market psychology. We are the market, if only we can let ourselves mimic the mind of the market and not permit individuality to rule our decisions.</p>

<h2>Shawn Powell</h2>

<p><blockquote><p>"Count to ten rule"</p></blockquote></p>

<p>If you are in that much of a hurry, you probably haven't done your analysis or you might be chasing a move. Do you know your stop and take profit levels? One quick review, count to ten and then take the trade.</p>

<h2>Dr Sivaraman</h2>

<p><blockquote><p>"Pay attention to quick, false and intentional moves"</p></blockquote></p>

<p>1.Quick moves are false moves in the market : use such moves to do counter trades once the new low or high is not breached for 30 min in a session.2. False moves may be seen before the data release and the intentional move may be seen after the data : a drop before we may initiate buy and a rise before data we can initiate sell to quickly close in or keep stop at entry in in first 30 min of entry.</p>

<h2>Derek Frey</h2>

<p><blockquote><p>"you can't predict the future..."</p></blockquote></p>

<p>The biggest thing that got me from a losing trader to a winning trader was the realization that I did not have to know the future to be successful. Many new traders think that trading is all about know what is coming next, but of course no one can really predict the future. So for me realizing that this business is all about playing the odds rather than knowing the future was the single biggest epiphany that got me over the hump. I now focus on Harmonics and the statistical edge that they provide. If you don't know what your edge is, you don't have one!</p>

<h1>Trend Following</h1>

<h2>Greg Michalowski</h2>

<p><blockquote><p>"Three's a Crowd"</p></blockquote></p>

<p>Most people know the old saying "Two's Company. Three's a Crowd". I use that easily remembered saying, to help define a nontrending forex market that is likely to transition into a trending market.I can use the Three's Company setup on a 5 minute, hourly or daily chart. The "two" in my trade are two moving averages.</p>

<p>Specifically, I use the 100 and 200 bar Simple Moving Average. The "three" in my trade is the current price. When the 100 and 200 bar MA converge with the price, it says to me it is time for the price : the third wheel in the group : to move away. Traders should simply look for a price break and go with the break. Risk is initially defined by using the 100 bar moving average. Should the price move back over the 100 bar MA look to exit the trade.The bonus is traders who recognize the setup, should also have confidence to stay with the trend.</p>

<p>The reason is if you can anticipate a trend move, focus is confidently on the trend. Also risk is defined and limited. Traders can use a cross over the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement as an exit, or simply wait for the price to cross back over the 100 bar MA. Often because the setup starts a trend, the price will reach a support level, tire and rest. This provides the trader with a number of options for a graceful exit.</p>

<h2>Mohammed Isbeer</h2>

<p><blockquote><p>"Never go against the general trend"</p></blockquote></p>

<p>Identifying the general trend whether on the short/medium/long term is the most essential, and when you figure it out, you stay with the trend. You buy on dips or sell on rallies according whether it's a down or up trend, but you never bet on a correction against the general trend.Committing to this rule will protect you from sudden and huge losses, as well as guarantees that you will be able to gain the most from a trend when the right moves happen.</p>

<h2>Kathy Lien</h2>

<p><blockquote><p>"Stick With the Trend: Tops &amp; Bottoms only evident in Hindsight"</p></blockquote></p>

<p>The trend is your friend may be one of the oldest maxims in trading but it is also one of the most important when it comes to the forex market. Trends in currencies can last for days, weeks and sometimes even months. Currencies are typically seen as little confidence indicators for a country and the outlook for a country usually gets progressively better or worse.</p>

<p>Also, due to the significant amount of participation and speculation in the forex market, when sentiment turns in one direction, it can be very strong and lead to sharp moves in currency values. As a result, I have generally found far greater success going with a trend than fading it. Tops and bottoms are only evident in hindsight and it is much better to wait for confirmation that a trend has ended than to arbitrarily pick a top or bottom.</p>

<p>The biggest fear of many traders is that they buy the top or sell the low. To avoid this, I prefer to join a trend at value. There are many ways to identify the value points through the use of my Double Bollinger Band Strategy or retrace to a Moving Average.</p>

<h2>Raghee Horner</h2>

<p><blockquote><p>"Don't Fight the Daily Market Trend"</p></blockquote></p>

<p>Over the years I have been using the daily timeframe for what I call Directional Bias. The reason for this is because I don't want to fight the larger, more dominant trend : it's like swimming upstream otherwise : much more effort it needed. The dominant trend reflects the psychology of the market.</p>

<p>Remember that all those candles or bars on your chart are simply graphing human emotions: fear, greed, confusion, anticipation.The daily chart will also assist me in determining whether my intraday set ups are trendfollowing or countertrend. If I am going to enter a market in a direction that is opposite the daily's Directional Bias I want to be sure it's on a shortterm time frame like a five, 15, or 30minute so in this was I am not dependent on longerterm countertrend movement.</p>

<p>I think many traders would benefit from starting their analysis with the daily : not necessarily to trade that time frame : but the understand the dominant psychology at work in the market.</p>

<h2>Wayne McDonnell</h2>

<p><blockquote><p>"Multiple time frames to trade forex"</p></blockquote></p>

<p>I always start my trade planning by looking at the Daily chart.On the Daily chart I look to see where price is in relation to shortterm moving averages. I like to trade in the direction of the trend. This means that I'm either trading at/near the moving averages and cautious when price is far from the moving averages due to the possibility of a mean reversion.</p>

<p>Based on this analysis, I create a bias. I'm either a bull or a bear. As a bull, I look to buy dips on the smaller time frames. As a bear, I sell rallies on the smaller time frames. Without bias, I am neutral and often don't trade at all.For example, if my daily chart bias is bearish, I look for resistance and over bought conditions on the lower time frames. If we are at a Daily R Pivot that is near a psychological round number, I see this as possible resistance.</p>

<p>I then check the 15 min stochs to see if there is any steam left in the current "up" move. If not, I'll look for moving averages crossing down, lower lows and such. The rest is trade management... and praying doesn't hurt.</p>

<h1>Miscellany</h1>

<h2>Supply &amp; Demand</h2>

<p>Thomas A. Meyers "Price movements are simply the reflection of changes in supply and demand. The technician does not care what the underlying forces of a shift in supply and demand are, rather he is interested in what occurs. If demand is greater than supply, prices will increase. On the other hand, if supply is greater than demand, prices will decline. The study of market prices is all that is necessary."</p>

    <id>http://mrelectron.github.com/blog/2012/04/29/order-types</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This post is about execution orders in particular about the types of orders you can make when you execute a trade.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>Order Types</h2>

<p>Most brokers allow traders 2 different ways in which they can enter the market. Traders have the option to either enter the market instantly or wait for a predetermined level to be reached and then automatically enter the market. These are known as Market orders and Pending orders.</p>

<h3>Market Orders</h3>

<p>These are the most basic way of trading. A trader will decide which way they think the market is going and either buy or sell at the current price. After determining the size of their position the trader simply has to click on buy or sell and the trade is opened instantly by their broker.</p>

<h3>Pending Orders</h3>

<p>There are 3 different types of pending orders that can be placed on most brokers" platforms; stop order, limit order &amp; OCO order. Pending orders are placed a specific levels predetermined by the trader. The trader will place either a buy or sell trade and wait for the market to reach the level they are waiting for before their order goes "live".</p>

<h3>Stop Orders</h3>

<p>These types of orders can be placed when the trader wants to wait for the market to reach a certain level before entering their trade. These types of orders can be placed when the market is ranging (no clear direction) either above or below the range. The traders order is triggered when the market moves up or down to their predetermined level depending on the direction they are expecting.</p>

<h3>Buy Stop</h3>

<p>As you can see below the pending buy order is placed above the current market price. The trader expects the price to continue rising after they have been triggered into the trade.</p>

<p><img src="/images/20120429-0001.png"></p>

<h3>Sell Stop</h3>

<p>As you can see the pending order is placed below the current market price. The trade expects the market to continue falling after they have been entered into the trade</p>

<p><img src="/images/20120429-0002.png"></p>

<h3>Limit Orders</h3>

<p>These types of orders can be placed when the trade wants to wait for the market to reach a certain level before entering their trade. They are different to stop orders. As we know, when a trader places a buy/sell stop they are expecting the market to continue moving in the same direction. Limit orders however are slightly different. The trade will place a buy or sell limit at a higher or lower price than the current market price. However they will expect the market to "bounce" of their entry price and move in the opposite direction. For example a buy limit may be placed when the trader expects the market to move up before moving down therefore placing a sell limit at a higher price than the current market price hoping to enter the trade at a better price.</p>

<h3>Buy Limit</h3>

<p>As you can see the trader expects the market to slightly fall before rising. They have placed a buy limit below the current market price.</p>

<p><img src="/images/20120429-0003.png"></p>

<h2>Sell Limit</h2>

<p>As you can see below the trader expects the market to rise before falling. They have placed a sell limit order above the current market price.</p>

<p><img src="/images/20120429-0004.png"></p>

<h3>OCO Orders</h3>

<p>Many brokers allow traders the option to place OCO orders. OCO means "order cancels other". These are 2 orders placed on the same currency pair. One is a buy stop and the other is a sell stop. The trader expects the market to move either up or down and dosnt want to miss out on the move. They place a buy stop above the current market price and a sell stop below the current market price. When either the buy or sell have been triggered the other pending trade is automatically cancelled.</p>

<p><img src="/images/20120429-0005.png"></p>

<h3>GTC Orders</h3>

<p>These types of orders are an "add on" to the 3 types of orders we"ve just discussed. GTC means Good Till Cancelled. This means that the order placed by the trader will remain in the market until cancelled by them. Many brokers also allow the option to add a "valid until" part to a pending trade. This means that predetermined time can be set by the trader before the trade is closed by the broker automatically.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>What is forex?</h2>

<p>The forex market is an over the counter (OTC) market. Unlike the stock market that requires a buyer and seller to go though a centralized exchange (i.e. The New York Stock Exchange) which will have just one price, the forex market is a decentralized market. This means currency/forex dealers can offer different prices/quotes for currency pairs resulting in better choices and deals for the buyer and seller. Foreign exchange deals are made between 2 participants; the buyer and the seller.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>Who trades Forex?</h2>

<p>Foreign currency can be traded by almost anyone. The main players are the Banks &amp; large financial institutions. We then have commercial traders such as hedge funds and large commercial corporations. Finally we have you and me, the retail traders.</p>

<p>It"s the big banks and financial institutions that have most the power and control over the price in the forex market. They will only trade between themselves and together these banks and financial institutions are known as the interbank market.</p>

<p>Commercial corporations often engage in international transactions and as a result have an affect and influence of exchange rates. Hedge funds and retail traders trade for the sole purpose of making money, be it though hedging, speculation and investing. These types of traders are at the bottom of the forex food chain. Retail traders especially have no influence in exchange rate prices. Larger hedge funds with substantial funds at their disposal can in certain cases have enough collateral to move or influence a currencies price.</p>

<h2>How to Read Quotes</h2>

<p>Reading a foreign exchange quote is simple if you remember two things</p>

<p><blockquote><p>The first currency listed is the base currency<br/>The value of the base currency is always 1.</p></blockquote></p>

<p>As we know all currencies are always quoted in pairs. Every time you make a forex trade or transaction you are simultaneously buying one currency and selling another.</p>

<p>If you were to sell GBP/USD you would be selling the British Pound and at the same time buying the USD.</p>

<p>The base currency is the "head" or "lead" currency in any pair. Whenever you open a trade and buy or sell, you are always buying or selling the base currency and doing the opposite to the quote currency. Whenever you close a trade you are either buying back what you sold or selling back what you bought.</p>

<p>The base currency is known as the Transaction Currency, while the second currency in the pair is the Settlement Currency.   The quantity bought and sold will apply directly to the Transaction Currency, while the gains and losses from transactions will apply to the Settlement Currency.  When you buy a currency pair you are going long the Transaction Currency while simultaneously shorting the Settlement Currency.  Conversely, when you sell a currency pair you are shorting the Transaction Currency while simultaneously buying the Settlement Currency.  Since the forex market is foreign exchange, each transaction must contain one currency against another.</p>

<h2>Exchange Rates</h2>

<p>For every forex pair we trade it has an exchange rate. It is the change in this exchange rate that determines how much money we make as traders. When placing a trade we are simply speculating on whether a currency will rise or fall against another. It is important to understand how exchange rates work. ::</p>

<p><blockquote><p>GBP/USD = 1.5279</p></blockquote></p>

<p>Above we can see GBP/USD with its exchange rate quoted. The exchange rate is telling us how much we need in units of the of the quote currency (the one on the right) to buy one unit of the base currency (the one on the left).</p>

<p><blockquote><p>We would need to spend 1.5279 USD in order to buy 1 GBP.<br/>We would need to spend 1 GBP in order to buy 1.5279 USD"s.</p></blockquote></p>

<h2>Buying &amp; Selling</h2>

<p>In the forex market you can either buy or sell a currency. When buying you are expecting the base currency to rise against the quote currency and when selling you are expecting the quote currency to rise against the base currency.</p>

<p>BUY GBP/USD - if you were to buy the GBP/USD you expect the Pound to "gain strength" over the USD therefore pushing the exchange rate of the GBP/USD up.</p>

<p>SELL GBP/USD - if you were to sell the GBP/USD you expect the Pound to "weaken" against the USD therefore pushing the exchange rate of the GBP/USD down.</p>

<p><blockquote><p>"I've gone long on Cable" Translates to "I've bought the GBP/USD"<br/>"I'm short on the Aussie" Translates to "I'm selling the AUD/USD"</p></blockquote></p>

<h2>Pips</h2>

<p>Price intercept points are more commonly known as PIPs. A pip is the smallest unit by which a currency quote can change. If the rate for EUR/USD is 1.3574 and it changes to 1.3575 that change is a 1 pip movement. It is these changes in forex prices that we as traders look for in order to make money from the markets. ::</p>

<p><blockquote><p>EUR/USD = 1.3574 - EUR/USD = 1.3575<br/>You can see above the price has increased by 1 pip.</p></blockquote></p>

<p>The pip is always the 4th number after the decimal point; however, pairs that include the Japanese yen only have 2 digits after the decimal point, in this case the pip is the 2nd number after the decimal point. For example if the rate for EUR/JPY is 132.87 and it changes to 132.88 that change is a 1 pip movement. Some brokers are now offering an extra digit at the end of their quotes which shows a fraction of a pip. ::</p>

<p><blockquote><p>EUR/USD = 1.35754</p></blockquote></p>

<p>In the quote above the 4 is the PIP and the 5 is the pip fraction. Fractions of pips do not make too much difference to trading however it is worth keeping an eye out especially if your broker is using them in their quotes.</p>

<h2>Spread Bid &amp; Ask</h2>

<p>Just like other markets, forex quotes consist of two sides, the bid and the ask::</p>

<p><blockquote><p>The BID is the price at which you can SELL base currency.<br/>The ASK is the price at which you can BUY base currency.</p></blockquote></p>

<p>The prices you can sell or buy a currency are different to one and other. It is this difference in price that is known as the Spread. The spread is where the broker makes his money. Spread is usually a few pips and all brokers will offer different spreads. Obviously the lower the spread the better for us as traders so it"s a good idea to search for brokers who offer low spreads.</p>

<p>Spreads can fluctuate during times of high market volatility. Some brokers may offer fixed spreads. It is the trader"s personal choice as to which broker they do business with.</p>

<p>The bid price is the price the broker has offered if you wish to sell a currency pair. The ask price is the price the broker has offered if you wish to buy a currency pair. The difference between the bid and ask is known as the spread. ::</p>

<p><blockquote><p>Bid     Ask<br/>1.3486  1.3488</p></blockquote></p>

<h2>Lots</h2>

<p>Forex is traded using specific amounts called Lots. A lot is the amount of units you are trading with. The standard lot size is 100,000 units. The size of the lot will determine the value per pip. Knowing the value per pip is critical in order to work out how much money you will make or lose per trade. Lots come in 4 sizes. ::</p>

<p><blockquote><p>Standard    100,000 units<br/>Mini        10,000 units<br/>Micro       1,000 units<br/>Nano        100 units</p></blockquote></p>

<p>Many brokers also have the option to trade using flexible lots, for example 1.5 standard lots (150,000 units). You can use the size of the lot to determine the value of a pip which you can use to help calculate how much you will win or lose on any particular trade. The value of a pip can be worked out using a simple formula ::</p>

<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>Pip value = (.0001/exchange rate) x lot size x exchange rate
</span><span class='line'>Example: EUR/USD = 1.3592, Use 1 standard lot (100,000)
</span><span class='line'>Pip value = (.0001/1.3592) x 100,000 x 1.3592 = 9.999 (rounded up) = $10</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div></p>

<p>This means that if we were to trade the EUR/USD using 1 standard lot size, each pip will be worth $10. If we make 100 pips on our trade we will be making $1000. There is a slightly different formula used to work out the value of a pip when the USD is the base currency. The formula for this is ::</p>

<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>Pip value = (0.0001/exchange rate) x lot size
</span><span class='line'>Example: USD/CHF = 1.1213, Use 1 standard lot (100,000)
</span><span class='line'>Pip value = (.0001/1.1213) x 100,000 = 8.918 (rounded up) = $9:</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div></p>

<p>This means that if we were to trade the USD/CHF using 1 standard lot each pip would be worth $9, if we make 100 pips on our trade we will be making $900.</p>

<h2>Leverage &amp; Margin</h2>

<p>New Account: Free Margin is equal to the entire account balance. If a brand new account balance is $1000,the deposit currency is USD and the broker has a minimum 1% margin requirement and the trader wants to execute a 0.3 Lot trade (assuming USD is the base currency, if it is not then the calculations are a bit more complicated), then the used margin after placing the trade can be computed by multiplying the trade size by the margin requirement (0.3 lots or $30,000 x 1% = $300).</p>

<p>If trading a xxxUSD pair:
<div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>Margin = StandardLot * quote * LotSize / Leverage
</span><span class='line'>Example (trading 0.5 lots of GBPUSD @ 1.3982):
</span><span class='line'>Margin = 100,000 * 1.3982 * 0.5 / 200 = 349.55 USD.</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div></p>

<p>If trading a USDxxx pair:
<div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>Margin = StandardLot * LotSize / Leverage
</span><span class='line'>Example (trading 0.1 lots of USDJPY):
</span><span class='line'>Margin = 100,000 * 0.1 / 200 = 50 USD set aside as margin (used margin).</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div></p>

<p>Leverage, in essence, is a loan that is provided to an investor by the broker that is handling his or her Forex account. When an investor decides to invest in the Forex market, he or she must first open up a margin account with a broker. Usually, the amount of leverage provided is either 50:1, 100:1 or 200:1, depending on the broker and the size of the position the investor is trading. Standard trading is done on 100,000 units of currency, so for a trade of this size, the leverage provided is usually 50:1 or 100:1. Leverage of 200:1 is usually used for positions of 50,000 units or less.</p>

<p>Although the ability to earn significant profits by using leverage is substantial, leverage can also work against investors. For example, if the currency underlying one of your trades moves in the opposite direction of what you believed would happen, leverage will greatly amplify the potential losses.</p>

<p>Margin is the aggregate amount of customer cash pledged against the aggregate Open Positions. The margin pledged is a function of Maximum Trading Leverage Ratio. The higher the leverage, the lower the pledged Margin. The lower the leverage, the higher the Margin needed to carry the position.</p>

<p>Margin - The amount of collateral a customer deposits with a broker when borrowing from the broker to buy securities. This is your account balance when you first open your account.</p>

<p>Leverage - The use of credit or borrowed funds to increase one's speculative capacity and increase the rate of return from an investment, as in buying securities on margin, although it can also increase the rate of loss by the same factor. Your leverage depends on the size of the trades you make relative to your account equity, and nothing else, as long as you don't surpass the maximum leverage the broker allows. This value is normally displayed as a DEBT:EQUITY ratio.</p>

<p>Margin requirement - expressed as a percentage, the margin requirement is set by your broker to protect itself against traders using too much leverage, or in other words, against traders borrowing more than their collateral would support according to the broker's risk management parameters. So when a broker's marketing team says their margin requirement is 1%, it means that they require 1% of your trade size in order to lend you the amount you need for the trade. For example if you are trading $100,000 position size, then the broker requires $1,000 (1%) of your margin in order to make the loan. As I stated before, this number generally does not vary unless you specifically change the deal with your broker. Furthermore, in this example we know what the margin requirement is, but we don't yet have enough information to calculate leverage, because we don't know what our account equity is (more about this later). Your broker would normally quote that as "100:1" leverage, which is not entirely accurate since our actual leverage also depends on our account equity. What they are actually saying is that your maximum leverage, based on their margin requirement, would be 100:1. How much of that leverage you actually use is entirely up to you, as long as you don't surpass this maximum.</p>

<p>A 100:1 leverage ratio means that your broker will lend you 100x what you have on margin in your account. This means that with only $1000 you can control $100,000 in the market. Using a higher leverage would mean you need to put less money in your margin account.</p>

<p>Calculate True Leverage:As we mentioned before, leverage in the financial markets is the DEBT:EQUITY ratio, so we need to calculate our debt and our equity.</p>

    <updated>2012-04-29T01:45:00+10:00</updated>
    <id>http://mrelectron.github.com/blog/2012/04/29/trading-plan</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This post describes my trading plan. It is good that this is a semi-public (semi-public in that I don't actively advertise this site, people who come here will only come here by accident) forum. It is good because it will force me to write a good trading plan and hopefully will make me follow it.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>Beliefs</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>I believe I only need to master one setup to be a consistently profitable trader. After I have mastered one setup and "own it" I can start to master another setup ... ad infinitum.</p></li>
<li><p>I believe that Price Action trading is the best approach to market analysis, because most technical analysis indicators are derivatives of price so why not just use price.</p></li>
<li><p>I believe that trading is gambling but it is possible to fix the odds slightly in your favour.</p></li>
<li><p>I don't care what moves the Forex market, my approach is very short term. So macro economic analysis will have no impact on my trading.</p></li>
<li><p>I do need to be conscious of calendar events while I have a trade open.</p></li>
<li><p>I believe that the psychological aspect (discipline, control of fear and greed) of trading is the most important thing in trading.</p></li>
<li><p>I believe the second most important thing is money management.</p></li>
<li><p>I believe the technical aspects of trading are irrelevant if you don't have good money management and control of your mind.</p></li>
<li><p>I do not know what the market will do. All I can do is use my experience and skills to allocate a probability to what the market will do.</p></li>
<li><p>I believe that compounding is vital.</p></li>
<li><p>I believe I can be successful at trading only if I take control of my self discipline and mind.</p></li>
<li><p>I believe losses are part and parcel of trading. Therefore losses should not upset me. Taking losses does not mean I'm a loser.</p></li>
<li><p>I believe leverage is a two edged sword, that holds the potential to bring me down.</p></li>
</ul>


<h2>Weakness</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>I lack self discipline</p></li>
<li><p>I do not have control of my emotions.</p></li>
</ul>


<h2>Strengths</h2>

<ul>
<li>TODO</li>
</ul>


<h2>Markets</h2>

<p>I have chosen to trade Forex. I have a couple of years experience trading equities in the USA via Contracts for Difference. But for the size of the account I was trading the round trip expenses were too much. So this time around I wanted a  market where I did not have to pay any transation fees on top of the spread. So that is the first reason I chose the Forex market, the second reason, is of course the leverage.</p>

<h2>Instruments</h2>

<p>My main criteria for an appropriate instrument was one with a low spread and high liquidity. Most crosses have a fairly high spread making them ineligible. For some reason (I have not examined too closely I'm not comfortable with the JPY pairs). Any of the major's were going to be OK, so pretty much randomly I chose the AUDUSD, EURUSD, and GBPUSD. But will focus for at least 12 months on the AUDUSD.</p>

<h2>Workflow</h2>

<h3>PreMarket</h3>

<ul>
<li>1500: Do daily analysis on each of D1,H4,H1 &amp; M15 charts.</li>
<li>Do screen capture of all 4 timeframes as individual fullsized images and as a single image of all four. For a total of five images.</li>
<li>Markup Economic calendar events on Chart.</li>
</ul>


<h3>InMarket</h3>

<ul>
<li>TODO</li>
</ul>


<h3>PostMarket</h3>

<ul>
<li>2330: Post daily analysis and each trade analysis to heterodoxic.com</li>
</ul>


<h2>Broker</h2>

<p>I have two brokers <a href="http://www.fxpro.com.au">FXPro</a> and <a href="http://www.pepperstone.com.au">Pepperstone</a>. When I was hunting for a broker, my major criteria was to find a broker that had tight spreads. These two brokers should allow me to trade AUDUSD, EURUSD and GBPUSD with a 1 pip spread.</p>

<p>I have only funded FXPro at this stage, and plan to use Pepperstone as a backup. FXPro has a slight pecularity in that there are two types of accounts, one type uses the <a href="http://fxpro.com.au/trading/cfd/mt4">Market Maker</a> model and the other uses an <a href="http://fxpro.com.au/trading/cfd/ecn">ECN</a> model. I have opened an account of each type but only funded the Market Maker model account. The main difference between the two accounts are that the ECN account offers a more direct route to the interbank market, it is aimed a bigger players and commissions are charged per transaction.</p>

<h2>Platform</h2>

<p>A platforms is required for strategy development, indicator development, charting and execution. I will use <a href="http://www.r-project.org/">R</a> for strategy development and <a href="http://www.metaquotes.net/">MT4</a> for indicator development.</p>

<p>Financial considerations and a desire to keep my monthly costs down for at least 12 months precludes the option of getting a seperate data and charting package. Therefore I will utilise the broker supplied platforms for charting and execution. Currently both Pepperstone and FXPro offer <a href="http://www.metaquotes.net/">MT4</a> for their charting and execution platforms.</p>

<h2>Timeframes</h2>

<p>I'm trading a small account. Therefore to maximise the magic of compounding, I'm will trade short-term on a M15 timeframe. I do not believe I have the temperament or quickness of mind for shorter timeframes.</p>

<h2>Trading Times</h2>

<p>Trading takes intense concentration, therefore I dont' believe I can be effective for an entire trading day. So I need to trade just a subset. There are two particular time periods that have high liquid and volatility which are the conditions best suited to create an environment in which it is possible to make some pips. The two periods are the first 3 hours of the London Open which is 0800-1100 UTC and the intersection of the London Open and the New York Open which is from 1300-1600 UTC. I will choose to trade one of these periods each day.</p>

<h2>Journal</h2>

<p>I will journal all my trades on the heterodoxic.com blog under the category Execution. I will also undertake to complete a daily analysis each day prior to the London open at 0800 UTC. I have setup two Octopress templates that set out the structure and content of these journal entries.</p>

<h2>Log</h2>

<p>I will log all my trades using journal.xlsx. This journal calculates position size, risk reward, risk.multiple which I will complete before executing a trade.</p>

<h2>Withdrawals</h2>

<p>This area is important because one thing I found when trading previously was, if you leave money in your account you will blow it.</p>

<p>Money earned from the markets is considered by some to be just a temporary loan, as the market will take it back. The trading analogy to a casino is strongly correlated.</p>

<p>Each time my account increases by AUD1000 I will withdraw that AUD1000. This has the beneficial side effect of giving a reward for doing well.</p>

<h2>Money Management</h2>

<p>I should be risking an absolute maximum of 2% of my equity on a trade. But my account is so miniscule that I feel it is necessary to risk 5%.</p>

<p><blockquote><p>equity = account.balance + open.trades(winning) - open.trades(losing)</p></blockquote></p>

<p>Maximum leverage 100:1, again, way too much, I should only be applying a maximum of 50:1. But the miniscule account problem rears its ugly head.</p>

<p>If my account does grow then I will institute sane money management rules, 2% of equity and 50:1 leverage.</p>

<h2>Discipline</h2>

<h2>Rewards</h2>

<h2>Punishment</h2>

<h2>Mentor</h2>

<p>In the sense that these people are people whose opinion and methodology I respect and agree with.</p>

<h2>Paper Trading</h2>

<p>What to do here? I think paper trading will be good to with the LGP for 1 week.</p>

<h2>Strategies</h2>

<p>A Trading strategies, trading setups, and trading systems are synonyms, they describe a set of rules for executing a trade. A strategy can lie somewhere on a continumn between 100% discretionary and 100% mechanical. Whether you prefer a discretionary or mechanical approach is something you will struggle with and eventually find the right mix.</p>

<p>The strategies I utilise are:</p>
