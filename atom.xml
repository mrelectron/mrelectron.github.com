    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you have not watched <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0111149">Shallow Grave</a> by the <a href="www.imdb.com/title/tt0117951/">Trainspotting</a> director <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000965">Danny Boyle</a> then you will not care about this question, but there are 100 responses on the <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0111149/board/threads">message board</a> about Alex&#8217;s death. I have not seen that degree of interest in any film previously, so I thought I would add my opinion.</p>

<p>Naturally enough I thought to add the 101st opinion to the IMDB message board but IMDB not only want you to sign up to post a message they also want to you to submit your mobile number or credit card details. Thats beyond the pale so I have to post my opinion here where noone will read it, but thats OK.</p>

<p>First of all, I never for a moment thought he was alive and did not give the issue much thought until I read some of the messages about it, so I went back and had a look at the ending. Alex is dead! Why?</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Juliet is a doctor, she would have an excellent understanding of what it would take to kill Alex</p></li>
<li><p>Alex loses a lot of blood quite quickly. The blood on the floor does belong to Alex as David has already died. Also you can see how quickly he is bleeding out because the size of the blood pool increased rapidly.</p></li>
<li><p>Assuming the police arrived early the same morning he would have been laying there bleeding for at least 3 hours, and at the rate alluded to in point 2 he would have bled out.</p></li>
<li><p>Now even if the paramedics who were standing around were going to leave the knife in and saw (as in carpenter) around the body as some people seemed to think (that is so funny!). They would be still be physically close to him, kneeling by him, keeping him warm, offering moral support and managing his shock.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>Anyway the film is great and highly recommended. Get it, and you can make up your mind if Alex died or not.</p>
