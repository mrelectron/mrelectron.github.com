    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This post is my trading journal for the 08-May 2012, this is my first journal entry in my new guise of being a forex trader. I don&#8217;t actually plan to trade today, what sparked my interest was a comment by Goldman Sachs on April 25 to sell the Euro.</p>

<!-- more -->




<blockquote><p>The mighty Goldman Sachs has apparently recommended selling EUR/GBP at 0.8210/20 with a tight stop of 0.8250 and targeting a move back down to 0.8150/60</p></blockquote>


<p>I read this on the <a href="http://faithmightfx.com/2012/04/25/beware-trade-tips/">faithmightfx</a> blog, in a post called &#8220;Beware Trade Tips&#8221;. She thinks Goldmans are telling porky pies, and says that Goldman will be long the Euro. So I&#8217;m kinda interested in seeing how this pans out. Its a good chance for me to practice my trade analysis skills.</p>

<p>There is no facility within MT4 to assign keyboard shortcuts. But if you want to expand the range of keyboard shortcuts then you can use a free utility called <a href="http://www.autohotkey.com/">AutoHotKey</a>, you can then go crazy with keyboard shortcuts.  I found this basic AutoHotKey script for MT4 somewhere. Thanks to the anonymous user.</p>

<blockquote><p>There are two things which make it impossible to believe that this world is the successful work of an all-wise, all-good, and at the same time, all-powerful being; firstly, the misery which abounds in it everywhere; and secondly, the obvious imperfection of its highest product, man, who is a burlesque of what he should be. - Arthur Schopenhauer</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>All religions are equally sublime to the ignorant, useful to the politician, and ridiculous to the philosopher. - Lucretius</p></blockquote>




<blockquote><p>Atheism in its negation of gods is at the same time the strongest affirmation of man, and through man, the eternal yea to life, purpose, and beauty. - Emma Goldman</p></blockquote>




<blockquote><p>There was a time when religion ruled the world. It was known as the Dark Ages. - Ruth Hurmence Green</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>Isn&#8217;t killing people in the name of God a pretty good definition of insanity.- Arthur C. Clarke</p></blockquote>




<blockquote><p>The Bible is one of the most genocidal books in history. - Noam Chomsky</p></blockquote>

Science has been charged with undermining morality, but the charge is unjust.

Man would indeed be in a poor way if he had to be restrained by fear of punishment and hope of reward after death. - Albert Einstein</p></blockquote>




<blockquote><p>If people are good only because they fear punishment, and hope for reward, then we are a sorry lot indeed. - Albert Einstein</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>Be thankful that you have a life, and forsake your vain and presumptuous desire for a second one. - Richard Dawkins</p></blockquote>




<blockquote><p>The God of the Old Testament is arguably the most unpleasant character in all fiction: jealous and proud of it; a petty, unjust, unforgiving control-freak; a vindictive, bloodthirsty ethnic cleanser; a misogynistic, homophobic, racist, infanticidal, genocidal, filicidal, pestilential, megalomaniacal, sadomasochistic, capriciously malevolent bully. - Richard Dawkins</p></blockquote>




<blockquote><p>Religion is excellent stuff for keeping common people quiet. - Napoleon Bonaparte</p></blockquote>




<blockquote><p>Religion, to me, is a bureaucracy between man and God that I don&#8217;t need. - Bill Maher</p></blockquote>




<blockquote><p>I think flying planes into a building was a faith-based initiative. I think religion is a neurological disorder. - Bill Maher</p></blockquote>




<blockquote><p>The opposite of the religious fanatic is not the fanatical atheist but the gentle cynic who cares not whether there is a god or not. - Eric Hoffer</p></blockquote>




<blockquote><p>If there really is a God who created the entire universe with all of its glories, and He decides to deliver a message to humanity, He will not use, as His messenger, a person on cable TV with a bad hairstyle. - Dave Barry</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>The constant assertion of belief is an indication of fear. - Jiddu Krishnamurti</p></blockquote>




<blockquote><p>We could call order by the name of God, but it would be an impersonal God. There&#8217;s not much personal about the laws of physics. - Stephen Hawking</p></blockquote>




<blockquote><p>Black holes would seem to suggest that God not only plays dice, but also sometimes throws them where they cannot be seen. - Stephen Hawking</p></blockquote>




<blockquote><p>If God has made us in his image, we have returned him the favor. - Voltaire</p></blockquote>




<blockquote><p>Of all religions the Christian is without doubt the one which should inspire tolerance most, although up to now the Christians have been the most intolerant of all men. - Voltaire</p></blockquote>




<blockquote><p>Those who believe absurdities will commit atrocities. - Voltaire</p></blockquote>




<blockquote><p>Lighthouses are more helpful than churches. - Benjamin Franklin</p></blockquote>




<blockquote><p>The way to see by Faith is to shut the eye of Reason. - Benjamin Franklin</p></blockquote>




<blockquote><p>The way to see by faith is to shut the eye of reason: The Morning Daylight appears plainer when you put out your Candle. - Benjamin Franklin</p></blockquote>




<blockquote><p>Shake off all fears of servile prejudices, under which weak minds are servilely crouched. Fix reason firmly in her seat, and call on her tribunal for every fact, every opinion. Question with boldness even the existence of a God, because, if there be one, he must more approve of the homage of reason than that of blindfolded fear. - Thomas Jefferson</p></blockquote>




<blockquote><p>We are afraid of the known and afraid of the unknown. That is our daily life and in that there is no hope, and therefore every form of philosophy, every form of theological concept, is merely an escape from the actual reality of what is. All outward forms of change brought about by wars, revolutions, reformations, laws and ideologies have failed completely to change the basic nature of man and therefore of society. - Thomas Jefferson</p></blockquote>




<blockquote><p>The day will come when the mystical generation of Jesus&#8217;will be classed with the fable of the generation of Minerva in the brain of Jupiter. - Thomas Jefferson</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>I like your Christ, I do not like your Christians. Your Christians are so unlike your Christ. - Mohandas Gandhi</p></blockquote>




<blockquote><p>The fact that a believer is happier than a skeptic is no more to the point than the fact that a drunken man is happier than a sober one. The happiness of credulity is a cheap and dangerous quality. - George Bernard Shaw</p></blockquote>




<blockquote><p>If there were gods, how could I endure not to be a god. Therefore there are no gods. - Friedrich Nietzsche</p></blockquote>




<blockquote><p>Faith means not wanting to know what is true. - Friedrich Nietzsche</p></blockquote>




<blockquote><p>Convictions are more dangerous enemies of truth than lies. - Friedrich Nietzsche</p></blockquote>




<blockquote><p>Which is it, is man one of God&#8217;s blunders or is God one of man&#8217;s. - Friedrich Nietzsche</p></blockquote>




<blockquote><p>In Christianity neither morality nor religion come into contact with reality at any point. - Friedrich Nietzsche</p></blockquote>




<blockquote><p>I believe in God, only I spell it Nature. - Frank Lloyd Wright</p></blockquote>




<blockquote><p>We must question the story logic of having an all-knowing all-powerful God, who creates faulty Humans, and then blames them for his own mistakes. - Gene Roddenberry</p></blockquote>




<blockquote><p>To surrender to ignorance and call it God has always been premature, and it remains premature today. - Isaac Asimov</p></blockquote>




<blockquote><p>Properly read, the bible is the most potent force for Atheism ever conceived. - Isaac Asimov</p></blockquote>




<blockquote><p>If I were not an atheist, I would believe in a God who would choose to save people on the basis of the totality of their lives and not the pattern of their words. I think he would prefer an honest and righteous atheist to a TV preacher whose every word is God, God, God, and whose every deed is foul, foul, foul. - Isaac Asimov</p></blockquote>




<blockquote><p>A man is accepted into a church for what he believes and he is turned out for what he knows. - Mark Twain</p></blockquote>




<blockquote><p>It ain&#8217;t the parts of the Bible that I can&#8217;t understand that bother me, it is the parts that I do understand. - Mark Twain</p></blockquote>




<blockquote><p>I do not fear death. I had been dead for billions and billions of years before I was born, and had not suffered the slightest inconvenience from it. - Mark Twain</p></blockquote>




<blockquote><p>Religion is regarded by the common people as true, by the wise as false, and by the rulers as useful. - Seneca the Younger</p></blockquote>




<blockquote><p>How can I believe in God when just last week I got my tongue caught in the roller of an electric typewriter.- Woody Allen</p></blockquote>




<blockquote><p>Not only is there no god, but try getting a plumber on weekends. - Woody Allen</p></blockquote>




<blockquote><p>If it turns out that there is a God, I don&#8217;t think that he&#8217;s evil. But the worst that you can say about him is that basically he&#8217;s an underachiever. - Woody Allen</p></blockquote>




<blockquote><p>Belief in the supernatural reflects a failure of the imagination. - Edward Abbey</p></blockquote>




<blockquote><p>With or without religion, you would have good people doing good things and evil people doing evil things. But for good people to do evil things, that takes religion. - Steven Weinberg</p></blockquote>




<blockquote><p>They felt that science would be corrosive to religious belief and they were worried about it. Damn it, I think they were right. It is corrosive to religious belief and it&#8217;s a good thing. - Steven Weinberg</p></blockquote>




<blockquote><p>I still say a church steeple with a lightning rod on top shows a lack of confidence. - Doug McLeod</p></blockquote>




<blockquote><p>The world holds two classes of men - intelligent men without religion, and religious men without intelligence. - Abu l-Ala al Ma&#8217;arri</p></blockquote>




<blockquote><p>I distrust those people who know so well what God wants them to do because I notice it always coincides with their own desires. - Susan B. Anthony</p></blockquote>




<blockquote><p>The invisible and the non-existent look very much alike. - Delos B. McKown</p></blockquote>




<blockquote><p>Atheism leaves a man to sense, to philosophy, to natural piety, to laws, to reputation; all of which may be guides to an outward moral virtue, even if religion vanished; but religious superstition dismounts all these and erects an absolute monarchy in the minds of men. - Francis Bacon</p></blockquote>




<blockquote><p>A God who kept tinkering with the universe was absurd; a God who interfered with human freedom and creativity was tyrant. If God is seen as a self in a world of his own, an ego that relates to a thought, a cause separate from its effect. he becomes a being, not Being itself. An omnipotent, all-knowing tyrant is not so different from earthly dictators who make everything and everybody mere cogs in the machine which they controlled. An atheism that rejects such a God is amply justified. - Karen Armstrong</p></blockquote>




<blockquote><p>It is not as in the Bible, that God created man in his own image. But, on the contrary, man created God in his own image. - Ludwig Feuerbach</p></blockquote>




<blockquote><p>If I thought the Jews killed God, I&#8217;d worship the Jews. - Bill Hicks</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>All the biblical miracles will at last disappear with the progress of science. - Matthew Arnold</p></blockquote>




<blockquote><p>What can be asserted without proof can be dismissed without proof. - Christopher Hitchens</p></blockquote>




<blockquote><p>It will yet be the proud boast of women that they never contributed a line to the Bible. - George W. Foote</p></blockquote>




<blockquote><p>I contend that we are both atheists. I just believe in one fewer god than you do. When you understand why you dismiss all the other possible gods, you will understand why I dismiss yours. - Stephen Roberts</p></blockquote>




<blockquote><p>You do not need the Bible to justify love, but no better tool has been invented to justify hate. - Richard A. Weatherwax</p></blockquote>




<blockquote><p>What&#8217;s &#8220;God&#8221;? Well, you know, when you want something really bad and you close your eyes and you wish for it. God&#8217;s the guy that ignores you. - Steve Buscemi (From the movie &#8220;The Island&#8221;)</p></blockquote>




<blockquote><p>As far as I can tell from studying the scriptures, all you do in heaven is pretty much just sit around all day and praise the Lord. I don&#8217;t know about you, but I think that after the first, oh, I don&#8217;t know, 50,000,000 years of that I&#8217;d start to get a little bored. - Rick Reynolds</p></blockquote>




<blockquote><p>Calling Atheism a religion is like calling bald a hair color. - Don Hirschberg</p></blockquote>




<blockquote><p>God should be executed for crimes against humanity. - Bryan Emmanuel Gutierrez</p></blockquote>




<blockquote><p>To say that atheism requires faith is as dim-witted as saying that disbelief in pixies or leprechauns takes faith. Even if Einstein himself told me there was an elf on my shoulder, I would still ask for proof and I wouldn&#8217;t be wrong to ask. - Geoff Mather</p></blockquote>




<blockquote><p>Is God willing to prevent evil, but not able. Then he is not omnipotent. Is he able, but not willing? Then he is malevolent. Is he both able and willing? Then whence cometh evil? Is he neither able nor willing? Then why call him God? - Epicurus</p></blockquote>




<blockquote><p>I&#8217;m a polyatheist - there are many gods I don&#8217;t believe in. - Dan Fouts</p></blockquote>




<blockquote><p>A lie is a lie even if everyone believes it. The truth is the truth even if nobody believes it. - David Stevens</p></blockquote>




<blockquote><p>Men rarely (if ever) manage to dream up a God superior to themselves. Most Gods have the manners and morals of a spoiled child. - Robert A Heinlein</p></blockquote>




<blockquote><p>I refuse to prove that I exist,&#8221; says God, &#8220;for proof denies faith, and without faith I am nothing. - Douglas Adams</p></blockquote>




<blockquote><p>Isn&#8217;t it enough to see that a garden is beautiful without having to believe that there are fairies at the bottom of it too. - Douglas Adams</p></blockquote>




<blockquote><p>People will then often say, &#8216;But surely it&#8217;s better to remain an Agnostic just in case?&#8217; This, to me, suggests such a level of silliness and muddle that I usually edge out of the conversation rather than get sucked into it. (If it turns out that I&#8217;ve been wrong all along, and there is in fact a god, and if it further turned out that this kind of legalistic, cross-your-fingers-behind-your-back, Clintonian hair-splitting impressed him, then I think I would choose not to worship him anyway.) - Douglas Adams</p></blockquote>




<blockquote><p>I find the whole business of religion profoundly interesting. But it does mystify me that otherwise intelligent people take it seriously. - Douglas Adams</p></blockquote>




<blockquote><p>He that will not reason is a bigot; he that cannot reason is a fool; he that dares not reason is a slave. - William Drummond</p></blockquote>




<blockquote><p>There&#8217;s a phrase we live by in America: &#8220;In God We Trust&#8221;. It&#8217;s right there where Jesus would want it: on our money. - Steven Colbert</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>When a man is freed of religion, he has a better chance to live a normal and wholesome life. - Sigmund Freud</p></blockquote>




<blockquote><p>Take from the church the miraculous, the supernatural, the incomprehensible, the unreasonable, the impossible, the unknowable, the absurd, and nothing but a vacuum remains. - Robert G. Ingersoll</p></blockquote>




<blockquote><p>The inspiration of the bible depends on the ignorance of the person who reads it. - Robert G. Ingersoll</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>History teaches us that no other cause has brought more death than the word of god. - Giulian Buzila</p></blockquote>




<blockquote><p>Atheism is a non-prophet organization. - George Carlin</p></blockquote>




<blockquote><p>Religion easily has the best bullshit story of all time. Think about it. Religion has convinced people that there&#8217;s an invisible man living in the sky. Who watches everything you do every minute of every day. And the invisible man has a list of ten specific things he doesn&#8217;t want you to do. And if you do any of these things, he will send you to a special place, of burning and fire and smoke and torture and anguish for you to live forever, and suffer, and burn, and scream, until the end of time. But he loves you. He loves you. He loves you and he needs money. - George Carlin</p></blockquote>




<blockquote><p>I&#8217;m completely in favor of the separation of Church and State. My idea is that these two institutions screw us up enough on their own, so both of them together is certain death. - George Carlin</p></blockquote>




<blockquote><p>&#8220;There are no atheists in foxholes&#8221; isn&#8217;t an argument against atheism, it&#8217;s an argument against foxholes. - James Morrow</p></blockquote>




<blockquote><p>An atheist is a man who has no invisible means of support. - John Buchan</p></blockquote>




<blockquote><p>Gods dont kill people. People with Gods kill people. - David Viaene</p></blockquote>




<blockquote><p>If God were suddenly condemned to live the life which He has inflicted upon men, He would kill Himself. - Alexandre Dumas</p></blockquote>




<blockquote><p>Atheism is nothing more than the noises reasonable people make when in the presence of religious dogma. - Sam Harris</p></blockquote>




<blockquote><p>If we expect God to subscribe to one religion at the exclusion of all the others, then we should expect damnation as a matter of chance. This should give Christians pause when expounding their religious beliefs, but it does not. - Sam Harris</p></blockquote>




<blockquote><p>I don&#8217;t believe in God because I don&#8217;t believe in Mother Goose. - Clarence Darrow</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>Gods are fragile things; they may be killed by a whiff of science or a dose of common sense. - Chapman Cohen</p></blockquote>




<blockquote><p>When one person suffers from a delusion, it is called insanity. When many people suffer from a delusion it is called religion. - Robert Pirsig</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>What has been [Christianity&#8217;s] fruits? Superstition, Bigotry and Persecution. - James Madison</p></blockquote>




<blockquote><p>The characters and events depicted in the damn bible are fictitious. Any similarity to actual persons, living or dead, is purely coincidental. - Penn and Teller</p></blockquote>




<blockquote><p>If god is the alpha and the omega. The begining and the end, knows what has passed and what is to come, like it states in the bible, why do people pray and think it will make any difference. - Mark Fairclough</p></blockquote>




<blockquote><p>Religion is the impotence of the human mind to deal with occurrences it cannot understand. - Karl Marx</p></blockquote>




<blockquote><p>Religion is the opiate of the masses. - Karl Marx</p></blockquote>




<blockquote><p>Religion is the sigh of the oppressed creature, the heart of a heartless world, and the soul of soulless conditions. It is the opium of the people. - Karl Marx</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>Animals do not have gods, they are smarter than that. - Ronnie Snow</p></blockquote>




<blockquote><p>I have observed that the world has suffered far less from ignorance than from pretensions to knowledge.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m not convinced about the value of affirmations, but then again maybe there is some value. In any case I do like to have a bet each way. These affirmations are by way of <a href="http://www.learntotradethemarket.com/">Niall Fuller</a></p>

<blockquote><p>What the mind of man can conceive and believe, it can achieve&#8221; - Napoleon Hill</p></blockquote>


<p>This is the most important motivational quote of all time, which is why I have it listed again. If you haven&#8217;t read Napoleon Hill&#8217;s Think and Grow Rich Book, I suggest you do so in the near future, it&#8217;s the single best piece of motivational literature ever written in my opinion, and it will likely have transformative effects on your trading and your personal life.</p>

<blockquote><p>I am a successful trader</p></blockquote>


<p>If you repeat to yourself everyday that you are a successful trader, it will make you a lot more likely to do the things that are necessary to become one. If you do not believe you are a successful trader, you will never become one, as with anything else in life, you have to believe in your cause or goal before you can make it a reality.</p>

<blockquote><p>I am consistently following my trading plan</p></blockquote>


<p>You need to approach Forex trading as a business and be strategic and logical in following your trading plan; don&#8217;t deviate. If you&#8217;ve taken the time to formulate a comprehensive trading plan based on your trading strategy, your trading will be the most effective when you follow your plan, since you were objective and clear-minded when creating it.</p>

<blockquote><p>I have a Forex trading journal and I use it</p></blockquote>


<p>If you have a Forex trading journal and you actually use it, you will be far ahead of most traders. It&#8217;s critical to keep a running track record of your trading performance so that you have a tangible piece of evidence that reflects your trading ability or lack thereof. A trading journal will also give you something to stay accountable too and help you remain disciplined and organized.</p>

<blockquote><p>I practice proper risk management</p></blockquote>


<p>It&#8217;s important to remember that trading success is defined over a large series of trades, not over one or two. This means that you should not give too much significance to any one trade, and the way to do this is by never risking more than you are comfortable with losing per trade. By that I mean, never risk an amount that keeps you up at night thinking about or watching your trades. Remember to take small losses and that you are going to have losing trades; it&#8217;s just part of doing business in the Forex market.</p>

<blockquote><p>I trade according to what the market IS doing, not what I think it &#8216;should&#8217; be doing</p></blockquote>


<p>We want to trade what we actually see on our Forex price charts, not what we &#8220;think&#8221; should happen or what we &#8220;want&#8221; to happen. At the end of the day, it doesn&#8217;t matter what you want the market to do; it&#8217;s going to do what it wants, so your job is to learn how to read its price action and take advantage of it, not fight against it.</p>

<blockquote><p>I will never take a trade unless my reward clearly outweighs my risk</p></blockquote>


<p>The goal of any trader or investor is to make sure that the prospective reward of a trade clearly outweighs the risk involved. You need to gauge the market structure prior to entering a trade and make sure there is a logical reason for expecting that the risk reward on the trade is at least 1:1.5 or 1:2 or better.</p>

<blockquote><p>I will not sit around and watch my trades after they are live</p></blockquote>


<p>There&#8217;s nothing wrong with checking in on the market every 4 or 8 hours, but if you are sitting there addicted to your charts like a junkie, you are going to self-sabotage your own trades and probably end up losing a lot of money in the process. We have to learn to let the market &#8220;do the work&#8221; and just forget about our trades for a while after they are live. The set and forget forex trading strategy is something that I stand by and that I implement in my own personal trading, because meddling in your trades after they are live is an emotional decision and thus it&#8217;s usually the wrong thing to do. Find anything to do except watch your charts after you enter a trade.</p>

<blockquote><p>I am not emotionally affected by my profits or losses</p></blockquote>


<p>Both losses and profits have the ability to induce emotional reactions in us. A loss can cause us to want to take &#8216;revenge&#8217; on the market and try and &#8216;make back&#8217; the money we just lost. A profit can cause us to become overly-confident or even euphoric, which can cause us to deviate from our trading plan and take a trade that is lower probability than what we normally would take. Either way, you have to always be on guard against making an emotional trade immediately after a trade closes out, whether it was a winner or a loser. The best thing to do is to simply remove yourself from the markets for 12 to 24 hours after any trade.</p>

<blockquote><p>I try to trade with the dominant daily trend as much as possible</p></blockquote>


<p>I know you&#8217;ve heard this before, and I know it&#8217;s very cliche, but it&#8217;s also very true; the trend is your friend. I am often amazed at how many emails I get from traders telling me they are losing money in the markets and simultaneously asking me to comment on the chart they&#8217;ve attached to the email that shows a counter-trend trade on the intra-day charts. The easiest way to make money in any financial market is and has always been trading with the dominant trend. There are times when trading counter-trend is warranted, but until you&#8217;ve mastered trend-trading you should forget about counter-trend trading. Remember, don&#8217;t fight the dominant daily chart trend, instead, capitalize on it and ride the momentum until it ends.</p>

<blockquote><p>I will not over-trade, I will be patient and let trading opportunities present themselves to me</p></blockquote>


<p>Don&#8217;t trade just because you feel like you have to or you want to &#8230; make sure there&#8217;s a real reason to do so and never trade when your pre-defined trading edge is not present. The downfall of most traders is over-trading, because most traders simply don&#8217;t have enough patience to trade forex like a sniper and not a machine gunner.</p>

<blockquote><p>I am not a gambler, I&#8217;m a professional trader and I will not engage in gambling my money in the markets</p></blockquote>


<p>Gamblers make random bets in casinos or elsewhere, and traders who don&#8217;t have trading plans or who don&#8217;t follow their trading edge are also gamblers. It&#8217;s really easy to click your mouse and put a trade on and hope to get lucky, kind of like pulling the arm of the slot machine at a casino. The difference is that you can actually develop and implement a high-probability trading edge like price action strategies when trading the markets. So, it&#8217;s up to you if you want to be a gambler or a trader.</p>

<blockquote><p>I will not interfere with my trades without just cause</p></blockquote>


<p>This one is similar to number 8, but it&#8217;s so important I wanted to touch on it again. Interfering with trades is usually an emotional reaction born out of risking too much or over-trading, both of which cause you to become overly attached to any one trade, which in turn causes you to over-analyze your trades and meddle with them once they are live. There are times when there&#8217;s just cause to interfere with your trades, such as a giant pin bar reversal that forms counter to your position, or some other opposing price action. However these instances are rare and it takes time and effort to develop your discretionary trading sense to the point where you can &#8220;effectively interfere&#8221; in your trades.</p>

<blockquote><p>I will never let the news or fundamentals influence my trading decisions</p></blockquote>


<p>Traders who fall into the temptation to over-analyze the thousands of Forex news variables that occur each day, usually end up losing their trading accounts pretty quickly. All market variables are reflected via the natural price movement of the market, so by analyzing and trying to &#8220;figure out&#8221; what&#8217;s going to happen by reading economic news or watching CNBC you&#8217;re simply adding unnecessary and confusing variables to your trading approach.</p>

<blockquote><p>I am happy to take a profit and I will not be greedy</p></blockquote>


<p>Take your profits when your targets get hit, don&#8217;t change targets in an effort to try and get &#8220;just a little bit more&#8221; profit. These attempts to get a &#8220;little more profit&#8221; are usually in vain, and they usually lead to you letting a winning trade turn into a losing trade. Traders with smaller accounts especially need to take logical profits as they come, in order to build their accounts up and their confidence. If you get a 1 to 1.5 or 1 to 2 risk reward, there&#8217;s nothing wrong with taking the money off the table. Don&#8217;t fall into the trap of hoping that every trade you take goes on a parabolic run in your favor, the markets ebb and flow, meaning they don&#8217;t go in straight lines for very long.</p>

<blockquote><p>I invest in my trading education & myself</p></blockquote>


<p>Investing in your own education is paramount to success in any field. Forex trading is no different; whether it&#8217;s a book on trading psychology or the knowledge of an experienced Forex trading coach, learning something each day to make yourself a better trader will only improve your edge in the markets.</p>

<blockquote><p>I believe in my trading strategy completely and whole heartedly</p></blockquote>


<p>It&#8217;s critical to your trading success that you learn and trade with a strategy that&#8217;s proven and that you personally enjoy trading with. You have to follow it without deviation by remembering the fact that one loss does not negate the whole trading strategy. Don&#8217;t jump from one strategy or system to the next just because you stumble upon a few losing trades; losing trades are a natural part of any trading method. The key lies in losing trades properly and making sure you are trading with a strategy that is both simple and effective, like price action.</p>

<h1>Technical Catalysts</h1>

<h2>Sam Seiden</h2>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;Focus On The Lowest Trading Activity&#8221;</p></blockquote>


<p>When identifying where the next turn in the market will be, most traders focus on where the most trading activity took place on a chart. This is also what everyone is taught to do. I don&#8217;t. I focus on the opposite, where the least amount of trades took place because this is where supply and demand is most out of balance and that&#8217;s where prices turn.</p>

<h2>James Chen</h2>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;Knowing The Strength & Weakness Single Currencies&#8221;</p></blockquote>


<p>Trading currencies is vastly different from trading other financial instruments. The key differentiator: currencies are traded exclusively as relative, rather than absolute, entities. Although all forex traders should be well aware of this, it warrants further emphasis that currencies are traded in pairs. What this really means is that currencies are not traded in isolation, but rather in terms of their relative values against other currencies.</p>

<p>If the dollar is weak, one should ask what exactly it is weak against. Is it weak across the board, or just against Canadian dollar, or Swiss franc, etc.? Is it strong against euro while weak against yen? When a significant bearish move occurs in EUR/GBP, was it a bearish EUR move, or a bullish GBP move, or both? These are crucial questions that all Forex traders should ask, and answer.</p>

<p>Knowing the strength/weakness statuses of SINGLE currencies, instead of just currency PAIRS, is key to understanding currency pair movements and intercurrency relationships. Pairing strongest currencies against weakest currencies is a highprobability approach. It is essential that traders knows at  all times the relative strengths and/or weaknesses of all the  single currencies that are being considered for potential trades.</p>

<h2>Adam Rosen</h2>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;Time Of Day : Less Is More&#8230;&#8221;</p></blockquote>


<p>The most significant economic data focuses around a number of basic themes including inflation, employment, growth, or lack thereof. News of this nature is typically released during the first few hours of each respective trading session. As traders react to the news, markets tend to enjoy periods of greater volatility and volume during these morning hours which are commonly known as the &#8220;active market hours&#8221;.</p>

<blockquote><p>LON 08001000 GMT<br/>NYC 13001500 GMT<br/>TYO 24000200 GMT</p></blockquote>


<p>The EUR/USD (5minute) displayed with the Bollinger Bands indicator clearly shows the most significant trend began and lasted during the first 2hours of the trading day. A &#8216;trendtrader&#8217; anticipating a breakout to the upside would have been handsomely rewarded by looking for that &#8216;higherhigh&#8217; that did in fact occur early in the UStrading session.</p>

<h2>Cesar B. Leiceaga</h2>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;Trading with Pivot Points&#8221;</p></blockquote>


<p>I&#8217;ve found as a determining tool to apply in the foreign exchange markets, both daily and weekly pivot points.Some basic principals first to trading with pivots: They act as support and resistance.</p>

<p>If prices accelerate and hold above its pivot point, market participants will look to buy or turn bullish. If prices trade below a pivot point, traders will be looking to sell or short confirming the sentiment has turned bearish. Rules I apply to trade trends with pivot points</p>

<blockquote><p>In Uptrends: Buy dips to the pivot point and add to the position in S1 and S2. Use S3 to place a stop loss order. Use R1,R2, R3 as profit targets. </p><p>In Downtrends:Sell rallies to the pivot point and add to the position in R1 and R2. Use R3 to place a stop loss order. Use S1,S2 and S3 as profit targets.</p><p>In Ranges:Range low: Buy in S1 or S2. Stop S3 and target the daily pivot point.Range top: Sell in R1 or R2. Stop in R3 and target the daily pivot point.</p></blockquote>


<p>It is important to remember that these techniques applying pivot points best work in liquid pairs or majors: EUR/USD, USD/CHF, USD/JPY and GBP/USD.</p>

<h2>Ross Yamashita</h2>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;Scan Smarter : Not Harder&#8221;</p></blockquote>


<p>When studying Elliott Wave or any other wave pattern recognition theory, so many traders put too much emphasis on what the wave count is with regards to the current market.Rather than getting so caught up in where the market is in the count, I scan the markets for only 4 &#8220;high probability&#8221; patterns : Impulse, Zig Zag, Ending Diagonal and Contracting Triangles.</p>

<p>Certain aspects of these 4 high probability patterns have shown high levels of probable outcomes and they all can be fairly easy to see, even without Elliott Wave indicators or software.I trade primarily 14 currency pairs and I scan all my charts within minutes. Once I see any potential high probability patterns, I then investigate further with more analysis.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not suggesting people should disregard all that Elliott Wave Theory has to offer : as a full understanding will help you in your trading.But ask yourself : Why am I trading?I, for one, enjoy trading and the challenges and excitement that come with it. However, the bottom line is, we&#8217;re all here to make money. So, put the odds in your favor and search for the high probability patterns</p>

<h2>Valeria Bednarik</h2>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;Market volume with no technical indicators&#8221;</p></blockquote>


<p>Determining market volume could be critical when it comes to forex trading, as we understand that technical signals have higher probabilities of success when they come along with the right volume. For example, the break of the neckline of a figure, or a support or resistance level, are always considered reliable if volume is high, while pullbacks to those areas should show a lower volume, to give our signal further support.</p>

<p>However, not everyone realizes that volume indicators tend to be tricky: several of those are just providing information about the volume traded in the broker/platform that we are using to work; they can&#8217;t measure the volume of the whole market. So how can we easily determine whether there is high or low volume at a certain moment?</p>

<p>The easiest way for me is mostly a visual trick: I turn to my 1 hour chart, or even 30 minutes one, when I see something that could be understood as a break or a sign. If that particular candle is at least twice as long as the average that the pair moves in that particular time frame, I understand there is high volume favoring my signal. For example, if the EUR/USD moves 25 pips per hour on average, the candle that triggers the signal should be at least of 50 pips (double the 25) or more. Easy, clean, and with no extra indicators to mess our trading strategy.</p>

<h1>Fundamental Catalysts</h1>

<h2>Aamar Hussain</h2>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;Adapt and Overcome&#8221;</p></blockquote>


<p>Always be willing and ready to adapt to the market. (a) Daily Ranges, (b) Volume and (c) Fundamentals, all provide key information and clues as to which technical analysis and trading strategies will work best in a particular environment. NO strategy or analysis method will work in all environments. If you keep a close eye on the abc and make copious notes and observations how changes in each effect market dynamics you will be able to ascertain which methods and strategies are most suited to each environment.Data and Evolution are Key.</p>

<h2>Charis Charilaou</h2>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;Focus on the main story&#8230; everything else is just noise&#8221;</p></blockquote>


<p>Markets are constantly moving and media try to publish as much information as possible in order to gain credibility and expand audiences. However, not all information is equal. You need to be able to screen out most of the news and focus on the main story. This is the only way to understand the Market and become efficient in any trading style. There is always a main story concerning a war, a political state, an economical point of view etc. This is what the market focuses on and this is what creates a trend. Everything else is just noise.</p>

<h2>John Kicklighter</h2>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;Know What Moves Your Trade&#8221;</p></blockquote>


<p>One of the most valuable lessons I have learned trading in the past few years is to first identify what fundamental driver or drivers the market deems most important for a particular currency or the market as a whole. It&#8217;s easy to get caught up in reviewing all the economic indicators or headlines that cross the wires and then trying to assess what kind of impact it could have on price action. Yet, if for example yield expectations are the market&#8217;s sole concern, we shouldn&#8217;t waste time monitoring growth numbers and potentially confusing an otherwise straightforward forecast. Furthermore, when looking for that primary catalyst, it is important to remember that the market always boils down to the equilibrium of risk and reward in one way or another.</p>

<h2>Dirk Du Toit</h2>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;You need a fundamental view.&#8221;</p></blockquote>


<p>If you use technical analysis you base your whole trading system on this principle: &#8220;The last price contains all information about price valuation&#8221;.A series of such &#8220;last prices&#8221; is a pattern and a pattern is predictive of future moves.The problem very short term minded traders experience is that the Big Players as a rule ignore their &#8220;last prices&#8221;. They don&#8217;t even consider an intra day price as important.It is completely irrelevant to them that that price you think is a high probability indicator exists!</p>

<p>Institutions pay armies of analysts to determine what is the &#8220;content of last prices&#8221;. What have been &#8220;factored in&#8221; in relation to a house &#8220;fundamental view&#8221;.Institutions do technical analysis under the continuous guidance of a fundamental view.If you know what is really in the price, your technical analysis becomes really predictive because you can judgethe potential action of traders with a larger time horizon and outlook than yours.</p>

<p>Simple technical systems become effective and profitable as part of a proper fundamental view. Ignore the fundamentals at your own risk! (And please, don&#8217;t confuse economic data releases with the real drivers behind currency prices.)</p>

<h1>Risk Control</h1>

<h2>Elizabeth Gregory</h2>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;Plan the trade, trade the plan&#8221;</p></blockquote>


<p>What usually hurts novice traders is poor risk management; choosing wildly optimistic profit targets in order to justify cripplingly painful stops and staying in losing trades far beyond the original plan. It&#8217;s human nature to take profit on winning positions too early for fear of losing small accrued profits and to hold onto losing positions (and worse, doubling down!) in the vain hope that the market must surely reverse soon.</p>

<p>One of the best ways to enforce good discipline is to ensure that when entering any trade, there are always predetermined stop and take profit orders entered and that the amount of capital you risk is AT LEAST as much as you aim to win.The ONLY adjustments that should be made after that should be to trail the stop tighter (to minimize losses/guarantee profits) while extending the profit target.</p>

<p>Once the action starts, you can be sure the trade will succeed or fail within the reasonable riskreward criteria that was decided with a cool head. What&#8217;s more, when relying on orders and not staring fixedly at every tick on open positions, trading becomes a much less stressful and emotional experience.</p>

<h2>Alberto Munoz</h2>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;Risk/Reward Ratio vs Investment Horizon&#8221;</p></blockquote>


<p>My main discovery about trading in the last months is that risk/reward ratio should be directly proportional to your investment horizon. That is, when you&#8217;re trading in very short time frames, scalping for a few pips, then you&#8217;re risk/reward ratio should be low, even lower than 1. The concept behind this is that it makes no sense to hold a position too much time waiting for a profit which is twice the stop loss: it won&#8217;t work as the market noise will probably hit our tight stop. On the other hand, when trading on higher time frames (i.e. daily) risk/reward ratios should be high, above 2 or more, as we have time enough to reach our target.</p>

<h2>Yohay Elam</h2>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;Never risk more than 2% of your account at once&#8221;</p></blockquote>


<p>As with anything new, you&#8217;re likely to make mistakes, learn from them, and then improve. Many new traders risk too much of their account, and burn it out before learning anything.Money management is the &#8220;secret&#8221; to avoiding this fate. This abstract idea can go down to the 2% rule. Making 2% an overriding priority means no stop loss movements, using lower leverage, making a bigger initial deposit, having higher spreads, or anything, else that will keep the losses limited. Some things are more comfortable to do than others, but keeping this rule will likely yield in better results for newbies in the long run : keep them away from burning their account.</p>

<h2>Ron Schelling</h2>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;Never use more than 2% equity risk when I place stops.&#8221;</p></blockquote>


<p>I am in trading since 1983, a time that there was no computer or realtime data, just a phone ! Data came in by telex and I draw the charts by hand, actually the best training I ever got. Today we have almost everything for free, realtime data, online brokerage, realtime charts etc.Still most traders make no money, at least not constant. I am happy to survive it so far and maybe this comes from discipline I learned in aviation to fly aircraft using strictly checklist for each part of the flight.</p>

<p>The best trading tip I can give you and which helped me to survive > 25 years of trading is as follows: &#8220;Never use more than 2% equity risk when I place stops.&#8221;For example, if I have 4 positions and all stopped out, I will lose max. 2% of clients account. So the stop level is important and so the number of contracts .If there is high volatility and a high daily range, than my number of contracts are smaller. If there is low volatility and smaller daily ranges, than my number of contracts are bigger. At any time, being stopped out in all positions, I will lose max. 2% on equity.</p>

<h1>Market Behavior &amp; Psychology</h1>

<h2>Keagan York</h2>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;Head not Heart!&#8221;</p></blockquote>


<p>It is always hard to take a loss. However, the first rule that needs to be adhered to by a novice trader is that positions can and will go against you and that stop losses are an important part of any trading strategy. I have been in the position where I have gotten emotionally attached to a position and didn&#8217;t trade with my head. On occasion, things ended up working out. However, more often than not, I ended up losing more money. In these situations, not only do you lose money but you also end up missing out on better opportunities because your ability to trade is compromised by the funding the losing position. So remember think with your head, not your heart and make the tough call!</p>

<h2>Joseph Trevisani</h2>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;Be modest in your confidence and thankful in your profits&#8221;</p></blockquote>


<p>When our trades lose money, whatever our logic, we can be sure we were not alone. But we can equally be sure that we were in the minority. Had we been in the majority the market would have performed as anticipated. The market decision process is that simple. It is a matter of putting our behavior in line with the majority as often as we can. The most effective tool to achieve that is our own empirically tested market psychology. We are the market, if only we can let ourselves mimic the mind of the market and not permit individuality to rule our decisions.</p>

<h2>Shawn Powell</h2>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;Count to ten rule&#8221;</p></blockquote>


<p>If you are in that much of a hurry, you probably haven&#8217;t done your analysis or you might be chasing a move. Do you know your stop and take profit levels? One quick review, count to ten and then take the trade.</p>

<h2>Dr Sivaraman</h2>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;Pay attention to quick, false and intentional moves&#8221;</p></blockquote>


<p>1.Quick moves are false moves in the market : use such moves to do counter trades once the new low or high is not breached for 30 min in a session.2. False moves may be seen before the data release and the intentional move may be seen after the data : a drop before we may initiate buy and a rise before data we can initiate sell to quickly close in or keep stop at entry in in first 30 min of entry.</p>

<h2>Derek Frey</h2>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;you can&#8217;t predict the future&#8230;&#8221;</p></blockquote>


<p>The biggest thing that got me from a losing trader to a winning trader was the realization that I did not have to know the future to be successful. Many new traders think that trading is all about know what is coming next, but of course no one can really predict the future. So for me realizing that this business is all about playing the odds rather than knowing the future was the single biggest epiphany that got me over the hump. I now focus on Harmonics and the statistical edge that they provide. If you don&#8217;t know what your edge is, you don&#8217;t have one!</p>

<h1>Trend Following</h1>

<h2>Greg Michalowski</h2>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;Three&#8217;s a Crowd&#8221;</p></blockquote>


<p>Most people know the old saying &#8220;Two&#8217;s Company. Three&#8217;s a Crowd&#8221;. I use that easily remembered saying, to help define a nontrending forex market that is likely to transition into a trending market.I can use the Three&#8217;s Company setup on a 5 minute, hourly or daily chart. The &#8220;two&#8221; in my trade are two moving averages.</p>

<p>Specifically, I use the 100 and 200 bar Simple Moving Average. The &#8220;three&#8221; in my trade is the current price. When the 100 and 200 bar MA converge with the price, it says to me it is time for the price : the third wheel in the group : to move away. Traders should simply look for a price break and go with the break. Risk is initially defined by using the 100 bar moving average. Should the price move back over the 100 bar MA look to exit the trade.The bonus is traders who recognize the setup, should also have confidence to stay with the trend.</p>

<p>The reason is if you can anticipate a trend move, focus is confidently on the trend. Also risk is defined and limited. Traders can use a cross over the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement as an exit, or simply wait for the price to cross back over the 100 bar MA. Often because the setup starts a trend, the price will reach a support level, tire and rest. This provides the trader with a number of options for a graceful exit.</p>

<h2>Mohammed Isbeer</h2>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;Never go against the general trend&#8221;</p></blockquote>


<p>Identifying the general trend whether on the short/medium/long term is the most essential, and when you figure it out, you stay with the trend. You buy on dips or sell on rallies according whether it&#8217;s a down or up trend, but you never bet on a correction against the general trend.Committing to this rule will protect you from sudden and huge losses, as well as guarantees that you will be able to gain the most from a trend when the right moves happen.</p>

<h2>Kathy Lien</h2>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;Stick With the Trend: Tops & Bottoms only evident in Hindsight&#8221;</p></blockquote>


<p>The trend is your friend may be one of the oldest maxims in trading but it is also one of the most important when it comes to the forex market. Trends in currencies can last for days, weeks and sometimes even months. Currencies are typically seen as little confidence indicators for a country and the outlook for a country usually gets progressively better or worse.</p>

<p>Also, due to the significant amount of participation and speculation in the forex market, when sentiment turns in one direction, it can be very strong and lead to sharp moves in currency values. As a result, I have generally found far greater success going with a trend than fading it. Tops and bottoms are only evident in hindsight and it is much better to wait for confirmation that a trend has ended than to arbitrarily pick a top or bottom.</p>

<p>The biggest fear of many traders is that they buy the top or sell the low. To avoid this, I prefer to join a trend at value. There are many ways to identify the value points through the use of my Double Bollinger Band Strategy or retrace to a Moving Average.</p>

<h2>Raghee Horner</h2>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t Fight the Daily Market Trend&#8221;</p></blockquote>


<p>Over the years I have been using the daily timeframe for what I call Directional Bias. The reason for this is because I don&#8217;t want to fight the larger, more dominant trend : it&#8217;s like swimming upstream otherwise : much more effort it needed. The dominant trend reflects the psychology of the market.</p>

<p>Remember that all those candles or bars on your chart are simply graphing human emotions: fear, greed, confusion, anticipation.The daily chart will also assist me in determining whether my intraday set ups are trendfollowing or countertrend. If I am going to enter a market in a direction that is opposite the daily&#8217;s Directional Bias I want to be sure it&#8217;s on a shortterm time frame like a five, 15, or 30minute so in this was I am not dependent on longerterm countertrend movement.</p>

<p>I think many traders would benefit from starting their analysis with the daily : not necessarily to trade that time frame : but the understand the dominant psychology at work in the market.</p>

<h2>Wayne McDonnell</h2>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;Multiple time frames to trade forex&#8221;</p></blockquote>


<p>I always start my trade planning by looking at the Daily chart.On the Daily chart I look to see where price is in relation to shortterm moving averages. I like to trade in the direction of the trend. This means that I&#8217;m either trading at/near the moving averages and cautious when price is far from the moving averages due to the possibility of a mean reversion.</p>

<p>Based on this analysis, I create a bias. I&#8217;m either a bull or a bear. As a bull, I look to buy dips on the smaller time frames. As a bear, I sell rallies on the smaller time frames. Without bias, I am neutral and often don&#8217;t trade at all.For example, if my daily chart bias is bearish, I look for resistance and over bought conditions on the lower time frames. If we are at a Daily R Pivot that is near a psychological round number, I see this as possible resistance.</p>

<p>I then check the 15 min stochs to see if there is any steam left in the current &#8220;up&#8221; move. If not, I&#8217;ll look for moving averages crossing down, lower lows and such. The rest is trade management&#8230; and praying doesn&#8217;t hurt.</p>

<h1>Miscellany</h1>

<h2>Supply &amp; Demand</h2>

<p>Thomas A. Meyers &#8220;Price movements are simply the reflection of changes in supply and demand. The technician does not care what the underlying forces of a shift in supply and demand are, rather he is interested in what occurs. If demand is greater than supply, prices will increase. On the other hand, if supply is greater than demand, prices will decline. The study of market prices is all that is necessary.&#8221;</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This post describes R-Multiples or Risk Multiples a trading money management concept made popular by Van Tharp.</p>

<p>R is simply the dollar risk per trade. It&#8217;s nothing but a reward-to-risk ratio. Dr. Tharp reveals the great secret of trading: The golden rule of trading is to keep losses at a level of 1 R as often as possible and to make profits that are high-R multiples.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>To calculate the R Multiple for a trade:</p>

<blockquote><p>Rmultiple = ProfitLoss / InitialRisk</p></blockquote>


<p>Example:</p>

<blockquote><p>InitialRisk: AUD175<br/>ProfitLoss: AUD350<br/>Rmultiple = 350 / 175<br/>Rmultiple = 2.00</p></blockquote>


<p>When I look at my results in terms of multiples of R I can easily tell how good or bad the trades were. I like to think of R-Multiples as telling you the efficiency of your system.</p>

<p>Also recording trades in terms of R-Multiples allows you to easily calculate your system&#8217;s expectancy.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This post describes expectancy one of the most important aspects of trading.</p>

<p>This article was written by <a href="http://www.tradermike.net/archives">TraderMike</a>.</p>

<p>Expectancy along with position sizing are probably the two most important factors in trading/investing success.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>In simple terms, expectancy is the average amount you can expect to win (or lose) per dollar at risk. Here&#8217;s the formula for expectancy:</p>

<blockquote><p>Expectancy = (ProbabilityWin * AvgWin) - (ProbabilityLoss * AvgLoss)</p></blockquote>


<p>As an example let&#8217;s say that a trader has a system that produces winning trades 30% of the time. That trader&#8217;s average winning trade nets 10% while losing trades lose 3%. So if he were trading $10,000 positions his expectancy would be:</p>

<blockquote><p>(0.3 * $1,000) - (0.7 * $300) = $90</p></blockquote>


<p>So even though that system produces losing trades 70% of the time the expectancy is still positive and thus the trader can make money over time. You can also see how you could have a system that produces winning trades the majority of the time but would have a negative expectancy if the average loss was larger than the average win:</p>

<blockquote><p>(0.6 * $400) - (0.4 * $650) = -$20</p></blockquote>


<p>In fact, you could come up with any number of scenarios that would give you a positive, or negative, expectancy. The interesting thing is that most of us would feel better with a system that produced more winning trades than losers. The vast majority of people would have a lot of trouble with the first system above because of our natural tendency to want to be right all of the time. Yet we can see just by those two examples that the percentage of winning trades is not the most important factor in building a system. As Dr. Van K. Tharp points out:</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8230; your trading system should have a positive expectancy and you should understand what that means. The natural bias that most people have is to go for high probability systems with high reliability.</p><p>We all are given this bias that you need to be right. We&#8217;re taught at school that 94 percent or better is an A and 70 or below is failure. Nothing below 70 is acceptable. Everyone is looking for high reliability entry systems, but its expectancy that is the key.</p><p>And the real key to expectancy is how you get out of the markets not how you get in. How you take profits and how you get out of a bad position to protect your assets. The expectancy is really the amount you&#8217;ll make on the average per dollar risked.</p><p>If you have a methodology that makes you 50 cents or better per dollar risked, that&#8217;s superb. Most people don&#8217;t. That means if you risk $1,000 that you&#8217;ll make on the average $500 for every trade - that&#8217;s averaging winners and losers together.</p></blockquote>


<p>In &#8220;Trade Your Way to Financial Freedom&#8221; Dr. Tharp defines the following four components of expectancy.</p>

<ul>
<li>Reliability, or what percentage of time you make money.</li>
<li>The relative size of your profits compared with your losses.</li>
<li>Your cost of making a trade. (commission &amp; slippage)</li>
<li>How often you get the opportunity to trade.</li>
</ul>


<p>The fourth item in that list is a very important and often overlooked aspect of trading. If you had two systems that both had the same positive expectancy, let&#8217;s say $100, the system that produced more trades would make more money over time. For example, system A produces 3 trades per week while system B produces 10 trades per week. After just one week B would have made $1,000 while A would only have made $300. Gary B. Smith has discussed this before:</p>

<blockquote><p>I think of my equity as inventory. In that respect, my goal is to maximize not profit per dollar, but profit per dollar per day. In essence, I try to make a small percentage on my equity each day, but compound that amount as rapidly as possible.</p></blockquote>


<p>And in another article Gary said:</p>

<blockquote><p>Q: What aspect of trading took you the longest to learn?</p><p>I&#8217;d say the view that my equity is the same as a retailer&#8217;s inventory. Your profit per piece doesn&#8217;t matter if you never turn your inventory. And your turnover doesn&#8217;t matter if you&#8217;re losing money on each sale. What matters is the turnover times profit per piece.</p><p>That&#8217;s the same concept I try to apply to my trading. I start with $1 and want to figure out how to quickly turn that into $10. Most people focus on buying a stock at $20 and selling it at $40, and they rarely care how long it takes them to do that.</p><p>However, if during that time I can buy 10 $20 stocks and sell them each at a 10% gain, I&#8217;m way ahead if I continue to compound my equity.</p></blockquote>


<p>To touch on the importance of the size of your equity and position sizing I&#8217;ll use part of a snowball fight metaphor that Tharp uses in his book:</p>

<p>Imagine that you are hiding behind a large wall of snow. Someone is throwing snowballs at your wall, and your objective is to keep your wall as large as possible for maximum protection.</p>

<p>Thus, the metaphor immediately indicates that the size of the wall is a very significant variable. If the wall is too small, you couldn&#8217;t avoid getting hit. But if the wall is massive, then you are probably not going to get hit. The size of your initial equity is a little like the size of the wall. In fact, you might consider your starting capital to be a wall of money that protects you. The more money you have, assuming all the other variables (the components of expectancy listed above) are the same, the more protection you will have.</p>

<p>Now imagine that the person throwing snowballs at you has two different kinds of snowballs &#8211; white snowballs and black snowballs. White snowballs are a little like winning trades. They simply stick to the wall of snow and increase its size.</p>

<p>Imagine that black snowballs dissolve snow and make a hole in the wall equivalent to their size. You might think of black snowballs as &#8220;antisnow.&#8221; Thus, if a lot of black snowballs were thrown at the wall, it would soon disappear or at least have a lot of holes in it. Black snowballs are a lot like losing trades &#8211; they chip away at your wall of security.</p>

<p>Tharp continues walking the reader through different scenarios and possibilities. Like considering the relative sizes of the snowballs of each color. What happens to your wall after being hit by some black boulders of snow? Or considering how the rate at which snowballs are thrown affects the wall.</p>

<p>You can see how important each aspect of expectancy is as well as the huge importance of both the amount of equity (the size of your wall) and position-sizing (which will determine the size of the snowballs).</p>

<p>Expectancy, position-sizing and other aspects of money management are far more important than discovering the holy grail entry system or indicator(s).</p>

<p>Unfortunately entry techniques are where the vast majority of books and talking heads focus their attention. You could have the greatest stock picking system in the world but unless you take these money management issue into consideration you may not have any money left to trade the system.</p>

<p>Having a system that gives you a positive expectancy should be in the forefront of your mind when putting together a trading plan.</p>

    <id>http://mrelectron.github.com/blog/2012/04/29/order-types</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This post is about execution orders in particular about the types of orders you can make when you execute a trade.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>Order Types</h2>

<p>Most brokers allow traders 2 different ways in which they can enter the market. Traders have the option to either enter the market instantly or wait for a predetermined level to be reached and then automatically enter the market. These are known as Market orders and Pending orders.</p>

<h3>Market Orders</h3>

<p>These are the most basic way of trading. A trader will decide which way they think the market is going and either buy or sell at the current price. After determining the size of their position the trader simply has to click on buy or sell and the trade is opened instantly by their broker.</p>

<h3>Pending Orders</h3>

<p>There are 3 different types of pending orders that can be placed on most brokers&#8221; platforms; stop order, limit order &amp; OCO order. Pending orders are placed a specific levels predetermined by the trader. The trader will place either a buy or sell trade and wait for the market to reach the level they are waiting for before their order goes &#8220;live&#8221;.</p>

<h3>Stop Orders</h3>

<p>These types of orders can be placed when the trader wants to wait for the market to reach a certain level before entering their trade. These types of orders can be placed when the market is ranging (no clear direction) either above or below the range. The traders order is triggered when the market moves up or down to their predetermined level depending on the direction they are expecting.</p>

<h3>Buy Stop</h3>

<p>As you can see below the pending buy order is placed above the current market price. The trader expects the price to continue rising after they have been triggered into the trade.</p>

<p><img src="http://mrelectron.github.com/images/20120429-0001.png"></p>

<h3>Sell Stop</h3>

<p>As you can see the pending order is placed below the current market price. The trade expects the market to continue falling after they have been entered into the trade</p>

<p><img src="http://mrelectron.github.com/images/20120429-0002.png"></p>

<h3>Limit Orders</h3>

<p>These types of orders can be placed when the trade wants to wait for the market to reach a certain level before entering their trade. They are different to stop orders. As we know, when a trader places a buy/sell stop they are expecting the market to continue moving in the same direction. Limit orders however are slightly different. The trade will place a buy or sell limit at a higher or lower price than the current market price. However they will expect the market to &#8220;bounce&#8221; of their entry price and move in the opposite direction. For example a buy limit may be placed when the trader expects the market to move up before moving down therefore placing a sell limit at a higher price than the current market price hoping to enter the trade at a better price.</p>

<h3>Buy Limit</h3>

<p>As you can see the trader expects the market to slightly fall before rising. They have placed a buy limit below the current market price.</p>

<p><img src="http://mrelectron.github.com/images/20120429-0003.png"></p>

<h2>Sell Limit</h2>

<p>As you can see below the trader expects the market to rise before falling. They have placed a sell limit order above the current market price.</p>

<p><img src="http://mrelectron.github.com/images/20120429-0004.png"></p>

<h3>OCO Orders</h3>

<p>Many brokers allow traders the option to place OCO orders. OCO means &#8220;order cancels other&#8221;. These are 2 orders placed on the same currency pair. One is a buy stop and the other is a sell stop. The trader expects the market to move either up or down and dosnt want to miss out on the move. They place a buy stop above the current market price and a sell stop below the current market price. When either the buy or sell have been triggered the other pending trade is automatically cancelled.</p>

<p><img src="http://mrelectron.github.com/images/20120429-0005.png"></p>

<h3>GTC Orders</h3>

<p>These types of orders are an &#8220;add on&#8221; to the 3 types of orders we&#8221;ve just discussed. GTC means Good Till Cancelled. This means that the order placed by the trader will remain in the market until cancelled by them. Many brokers also allow the option to add a &#8220;valid until&#8221; part to a pending trade. This means that predetermined time can be set by the trader before the trade is closed by the broker automatically.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Have you ever wondered how Warren Buffet made his millions? In this post we look at the concept of compounding. If you are at all interested in financial security for your children, you should be drumming this into your child&#8217;s head as soon as they can walk.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s a crime that school is the worse possible preparation for life. Having said that I did learn compounding at school, though it was in Mathematics and maybe I did not have the brains to realise its application in the real world.</p>

<!-- more -->




<blockquote><p>Thank you to Richard Stoyeck for this article. Richard&#8217;s background includes being a limited partner at Bear Stearns, Senior VP at Lehman Brothers, Kuhn Loeb, Arthur Andersen, and KPMG. Educated at Pace University, NYU, and Harvard.</p></blockquote>


<p>Some of you know about this, some of you don&#8217;t. Either way I&#8217;m going to give you the basics of compounding, plus a couple of new slants on the concept. I suggest you read The Magic of Compounding not just once, but several times. If you have children, print this write-up and give it to them to read. If they master this concept they will become rich.</p>

<h2>The Basics</h2>

<p>Compounding describes how numbers, or money, can grow. Numbers can grow in an arithmetic progression, for example 2,4,6,8,10,12 or 3,6,9,12,15,18, where one unit is added on at each step in the progression and that action provides the growth, or, numbers can grow exponentially, 2,4,8,16,32,64. In an exponential progression the increase comes by doubling the number at each step in the progression. See the difference? This is compounding.</p>

<p>Now the really amazing part, the magic, comes when you see how fast compounding will make money grow. And guess what! That&#8217;s right, I&#8217;ve got a little game to play with you, a little story to tell, that will illustrate this principle. This puzzle is as old as J.P. Morgan&#8217;s moustache comb, so if you&#8217;ve already been schooled in compounding you&#8217;ve heard it before. But didn&#8217;t I tell you to read this section several times? OK, then, solve the puzzle with us once more while I tell it for the first time to the children for whom &#8220;The Magic of Compounding&#8221; has just been printed out.</p>

<h2>The Puzzle</h2>

<p>I&#8217;m a wealthy and generous man, and I want to hire you to work for me for one month. Since I&#8217;m also flexible, I give you a choice: you can choose to be payed the entire month&#8217;s salary up front on the first day of your employment, or, I will pay you 1 cent the first day and I&#8217;ll double your pay every day for the rest of the month, but you won&#8217;t get the money until the last day of the month. So on the first day you&#8217;ll work 8 whole hours and you&#8217;ll have 1cent coming to you. But on the second day you&#8217;ll earn 2cents. Hold on, it gets better, the 3rd day with me you&#8217;ll have earned 4 cents, the day after that 8 cents and so on. Saturdays and Sundays are included just to give you a chance. Oh, by the way, if you take your pay all at once on the first day I&#8217;ll give you a million bucks ($1,000,000.00) cash. Seems like an easy choice, doesn&#8217;t it?</p>

<p>Well, you decide for yourself . Now let&#8217;s look at how much the individual who picked the penney-a-day plan are going to have at month&#8217;s end. Remember, on the one hand $1,000,000.00. On the other hand::</p>

<p>Hey folks, it&#8217;s day eight, you&#8217;re up to $1.28 and you only have a month. Maybe you are better off taking the one shot deal, the million dollars. Let&#8217;s see what happens::</p>

<p>If you work for me in September with 30 days you make over $5,000,000. In December it&#8217;s over $10,000,000! I have never met the child who didn&#8217;t leap at the $1,000,000 on day one. This is because human brains think arithmetically, not exponentially. You might say that we are hardwired to think in this linear way, that the software in our brains compels us to think about progressions as being simple arithmetic ones. Luckily though, how we think about things, our prejudices, our attitudes, and our mindsets, can all be changed and worked with. We can update the software! We can consciously change the way we think about numbers, money and investing by absorbing new information, namely, that when you make your money compound you can get rich sooner rather than later.</p>

<p>Teach your children to live a balanced life, and also help them master this concept and you will have very happy and very rich children. In stocks make money at the bottom by buying depressed securities that are going to come right back, making you a fortune as they rocket off the bottom. In the future make money with the Warren Buffet concept, or classical Graham and Dodd analysis.</p>

<h2>The New Slant</h2>

<p>Really understanding compounding will make all the difference in investing. I believe that Warren Buffett, the world&#8217;s greatest investor, is hardwired to think geometrically. He is rich beyond dreams because he totally gets the magic of compounding, and he executes on the concept. I am going to get these numbers wrong because I&#8217;m doing them from memory but it doesn&#8217;t matter. You&#8217;ll get the concept. Buffett started a partnership way back when. He had a number of limited partners invest with him, and he took 20% of the gains. In the late 1960s he terminated the partnership with his famous letter,</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;When you no longer understand the way the game is played, it&#8217;s time to leave the game.&#8221;</p></blockquote>


<p>I&#8217;m paraphrasing, even though it&#8217;s in quotes. Buffet took about $100 million out of that first partnership for himself, so he was working with $100 million, keep that in mind. In 1974 when the bear market bottomed, it might have been early 1975, he started another rise&#8230;he took over Berkshire Hathaway. Buffet, since the 1970&#8217;s, has been getting a compounded (remember that means exponential) growth rate of about 22 to 24%.</p>

<p>This is where I introduce you to the cousin of the Magic of Compounding, which is called the Rule of 72. With the Rule of 72 you can calculate how long it will take you to double your money at any given rate of return. OK? Let&#8217;s take an example. If you&#8217;re earning 12% on your money and you want to know how long it will take to double it (we&#8217;re compounding, remember?) divide 72 by 12, and your answer is 6. It will take 6 years to double your money. Let&#8217;s do another one. If you&#8217;re getting 6% on your money, divide 72 by 6 and you&#8217;ll see that it will take 12 years to double. If you&#8217;re getting 9%, it&#8217;s 72 divided by 9, or 8 years to double up.</p>

<p>As for Warren Buffett, he&#8217;s getting 22% on his money. This means you divide 72 by 22 and gee, in only 3.27 years, or every 3 years and 4 months, he doubles his money. Since he&#8217;s been at it about 35 years with that $100 million he had to play with, he&#8217;s doubled his original $100 million almost nine times. You get that by taking 35 years and dividing by a double every 3 years and 4 months. It equals 10.70, or let&#8217;s go with nine doubles to adjust for a rate of compounding that is varying. The key point is he&#8217;s not making 9 times his money with the $100 million, that would be an arithmetic progression that would give him $900 million. He&#8217;s making nine doubles, a geometric or compounded progression. Let&#8217;s see how that works::</p>

<p>I believe Buffet is worth about $47 billion. It doesn&#8217;t matter, he is somewhere in his ninth double. This is the magic of compounding! Also, he never sells. This means his money is doubling every three years and four months with no tax consequences. He gets taxed only when he sells. Under normal conditions, the money compounds until he dies, then it&#8217;s taxed at a capital gains rate in the far distant future. In Buffett&#8217;s case, he&#8217;s giving most of his wealth to the Gates&#8217; foundation to benefit society.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>What is forex?</h2>

<p>The forex market is an over the counter (OTC) market. Unlike the stock market that requires a buyer and seller to go though a centralized exchange (i.e. The New York Stock Exchange) which will have just one price, the forex market is a decentralized market. This means currency/forex dealers can offer different prices/quotes for currency pairs resulting in better choices and deals for the buyer and seller. Foreign exchange deals are made between 2 participants; the buyer and the seller.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>Who trades Forex?</h2>

<p>Foreign currency can be traded by almost anyone. The main players are the Banks &amp; large financial institutions. We then have commercial traders such as hedge funds and large commercial corporations. Finally we have you and me, the retail traders.</p>

<p>It&#8221;s the big banks and financial institutions that have most the power and control over the price in the forex market. They will only trade between themselves and together these banks and financial institutions are known as the interbank market.</p>

<p>Commercial corporations often engage in international transactions and as a result have an affect and influence of exchange rates. Hedge funds and retail traders trade for the sole purpose of making money, be it though hedging, speculation and investing. These types of traders are at the bottom of the forex food chain. Retail traders especially have no influence in exchange rate prices. Larger hedge funds with substantial funds at their disposal can in certain cases have enough collateral to move or influence a currencies price.</p>

<h2>How to Read Quotes</h2>

<p>Reading a foreign exchange quote is simple if you remember two things</p>

<blockquote><p>The first currency listed is the base currency<br/>The value of the base currency is always 1.</p></blockquote>


<p>As we know all currencies are always quoted in pairs. Every time you make a forex trade or transaction you are simultaneously buying one currency and selling another.</p>

<p>If you were to sell GBP/USD you would be selling the British Pound and at the same time buying the USD.</p>

<p>The base currency is the &#8220;head&#8221; or &#8220;lead&#8221; currency in any pair. Whenever you open a trade and buy or sell, you are always buying or selling the base currency and doing the opposite to the quote currency. Whenever you close a trade you are either buying back what you sold or selling back what you bought.</p>

<p>The base currency is known as the Transaction Currency, while the second currency in the pair is the Settlement Currency.   The quantity bought and sold will apply directly to the Transaction Currency, while the gains and losses from transactions will apply to the Settlement Currency.  When you buy a currency pair you are going long the Transaction Currency while simultaneously shorting the Settlement Currency.  Conversely, when you sell a currency pair you are shorting the Transaction Currency while simultaneously buying the Settlement Currency.  Since the forex market is foreign exchange, each transaction must contain one currency against another.</p>

<h2>Exchange Rates</h2>

<p>For every forex pair we trade it has an exchange rate. It is the change in this exchange rate that determines how much money we make as traders. When placing a trade we are simply speculating on whether a currency will rise or fall against another. It is important to understand how exchange rates work. ::</p>

<blockquote><p>GBP/USD = 1.5279</p></blockquote>


<p>Above we can see GBP/USD with its exchange rate quoted. The exchange rate is telling us how much we need in units of the of the quote currency (the one on the right) to buy one unit of the base currency (the one on the left).</p>

<blockquote><p>We would need to spend 1.5279 USD in order to buy 1 GBP.<br/>We would need to spend 1 GBP in order to buy 1.5279 USD&#8221;s.</p></blockquote>


<h2>Buying &amp; Selling</h2>

<p>In the forex market you can either buy or sell a currency. When buying you are expecting the base currency to rise against the quote currency and when selling you are expecting the quote currency to rise against the base currency.</p>

<p>BUY GBP/USD - if you were to buy the GBP/USD you expect the Pound to &#8220;gain strength&#8221; over the USD therefore pushing the exchange rate of the GBP/USD up.</p>

<p>SELL GBP/USD - if you were to sell the GBP/USD you expect the Pound to &#8220;weaken&#8221; against the USD therefore pushing the exchange rate of the GBP/USD down.</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve gone long on Cable&#8221; Translates to &#8220;I&#8217;ve bought the GBP/USD&#8221;<br/>&#8220;I&#8217;m short on the Aussie&#8221; Translates to &#8220;I&#8217;m selling the AUD/USD&#8221;</p></blockquote>


<h2>Pips</h2>

<p>Price intercept points are more commonly known as PIPs. A pip is the smallest unit by which a currency quote can change. If the rate for EUR/USD is 1.3574 and it changes to 1.3575 that change is a 1 pip movement. It is these changes in forex prices that we as traders look for in order to make money from the markets. ::</p>

<blockquote><p>EUR/USD = 1.3574 - EUR/USD = 1.3575<br/>You can see above the price has increased by 1 pip.</p></blockquote>


<p>The pip is always the 4th number after the decimal point; however, pairs that include the Japanese yen only have 2 digits after the decimal point, in this case the pip is the 2nd number after the decimal point. For example if the rate for EUR/JPY is 132.87 and it changes to 132.88 that change is a 1 pip movement. Some brokers are now offering an extra digit at the end of their quotes which shows a fraction of a pip. ::</p>

<blockquote><p>EUR/USD = 1.35754</p></blockquote>


<p>In the quote above the 4 is the PIP and the 5 is the pip fraction. Fractions of pips do not make too much difference to trading however it is worth keeping an eye out especially if your broker is using them in their quotes.</p>

<h2>Spread Bid &amp; Ask</h2>

<p>Just like other markets, forex quotes consist of two sides, the bid and the ask::</p>

<blockquote><p>The BID is the price at which you can SELL base currency.<br/>The ASK is the price at which you can BUY base currency.</p></blockquote>


<p>The prices you can sell or buy a currency are different to one and other. It is this difference in price that is known as the Spread. The spread is where the broker makes his money. Spread is usually a few pips and all brokers will offer different spreads. Obviously the lower the spread the better for us as traders so it&#8221;s a good idea to search for brokers who offer low spreads.</p>

<p>Spreads can fluctuate during times of high market volatility. Some brokers may offer fixed spreads. It is the trader&#8221;s personal choice as to which broker they do business with.</p>

<p>The bid price is the price the broker has offered if you wish to sell a currency pair. The ask price is the price the broker has offered if you wish to buy a currency pair. The difference between the bid and ask is known as the spread. ::</p>

<blockquote><p>Bid  Ask<br/>1.3486  1.3488</p></blockquote>


<h2>Lots</h2>

<p>Forex is traded using specific amounts called Lots. A lot is the amount of units you are trading with. The standard lot size is 100,000 units. The size of the lot will determine the value per pip. Knowing the value per pip is critical in order to work out how much money you will make or lose per trade. Lots come in 4 sizes. ::</p>

<blockquote><p>Standard     100,000 units<br/>Mini      10,000 units<br/>Micro      1,000 units<br/>Nano        100 units</p></blockquote>


<p>Many brokers also have the option to trade using flexible lots, for example 1.5 standard lots (150,000 units). You can use the size of the lot to determine the value of a pip which you can use to help calculate how much you will win or lose on any particular trade. The value of a pip can be worked out using a simple formula ::</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>Pip value = (.0001/exchange rate) x lot size x exchange rate
</span><span class='line'>Example: EUR/USD = 1.3592, Use 1 standard lot (100,000)
</span><span class='line'>Pip value = (.0001/1.3592) x 100,000 x 1.3592 = 9.999 (rounded up) = $10</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This means that if we were to trade the EUR/USD using 1 standard lot size, each pip will be worth $10. If we make 100 pips on our trade we will be making $1000. There is a slightly different formula used to work out the value of a pip when the USD is the base currency. The formula for this is ::</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>Pip value = (0.0001/exchange rate) x lot size
</span><span class='line'>Example: USD/CHF = 1.1213, Use 1 standard lot (100,000)
</span><span class='line'>Pip value = (.0001/1.1213) x 100,000 = 8.918 (rounded up) = $9:</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This means that if we were to trade the USD/CHF using 1 standard lot each pip would be worth $9, if we make 100 pips on our trade we will be making $900.</p>

<h2>Leverage &amp; Margin</h2>

<p>New Account: Free Margin is equal to the entire account balance. If a brand new account balance is $1000,the deposit currency is USD and the broker has a minimum 1% margin requirement and the trader wants to execute a 0.3 Lot trade (assuming USD is the base currency, if it is not then the calculations are a bit more complicated), then the used margin after placing the trade can be computed by multiplying the trade size by the margin requirement (0.3 lots or $30,000 x 1% = $300).</p>

<p>If trading a xxxUSD pair:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>Margin = StandardLot * quote * LotSize / Leverage
</span><span class='line'>Example (trading 0.5 lots of GBPUSD @ 1.3982):
</span><span class='line'>Margin = 100,000 * 1.3982 * 0.5 / 200 = 349.55 USD.</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>If trading a USDxxx pair:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>Margin = StandardLot * LotSize / Leverage
</span><span class='line'>Example (trading 0.1 lots of USDJPY):
</span><span class='line'>Margin = 100,000 * 0.1 / 200 = 50 USD set aside as margin (used margin).</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Leverage, in essence, is a loan that is provided to an investor by the broker that is handling his or her Forex account. When an investor decides to invest in the Forex market, he or she must first open up a margin account with a broker. Usually, the amount of leverage provided is either 50:1, 100:1 or 200:1, depending on the broker and the size of the position the investor is trading. Standard trading is done on 100,000 units of currency, so for a trade of this size, the leverage provided is usually 50:1 or 100:1. Leverage of 200:1 is usually used for positions of 50,000 units or less.</p>

<p>Although the ability to earn significant profits by using leverage is substantial, leverage can also work against investors. For example, if the currency underlying one of your trades moves in the opposite direction of what you believed would happen, leverage will greatly amplify the potential losses.</p>

<p>Margin is the aggregate amount of customer cash pledged against the aggregate Open Positions. The margin pledged is a function of Maximum Trading Leverage Ratio. The higher the leverage, the lower the pledged Margin. The lower the leverage, the higher the Margin needed to carry the position.</p>

<p>Margin - The amount of collateral a customer deposits with a broker when borrowing from the broker to buy securities. This is your account balance when you first open your account.</p>

<p>Leverage - The use of credit or borrowed funds to increase one&#8217;s speculative capacity and increase the rate of return from an investment, as in buying securities on margin, although it can also increase the rate of loss by the same factor. Your leverage depends on the size of the trades you make relative to your account equity, and nothing else, as long as you don&#8217;t surpass the maximum leverage the broker allows. This value is normally displayed as a DEBT:EQUITY ratio.</p>

<p>Margin requirement - expressed as a percentage, the margin requirement is set by your broker to protect itself against traders using too much leverage, or in other words, against traders borrowing more than their collateral would support according to the broker&#8217;s risk management parameters. So when a broker&#8217;s marketing team says their margin requirement is 1%, it means that they require 1% of your trade size in order to lend you the amount you need for the trade. For example if you are trading $100,000 position size, then the broker requires $1,000 (1%) of your margin in order to make the loan. As I stated before, this number generally does not vary unless you specifically change the deal with your broker. Furthermore, in this example we know what the margin requirement is, but we don&#8217;t yet have enough information to calculate leverage, because we don&#8217;t know what our account equity is (more about this later). Your broker would normally quote that as &#8220;100:1&#8221; leverage, which is not entirely accurate since our actual leverage also depends on our account equity. What they are actually saying is that your maximum leverage, based on their margin requirement, would be 100:1. How much of that leverage you actually use is entirely up to you, as long as you don&#8217;t surpass this maximum.</p>

<p>A 100:1 leverage ratio means that your broker will lend you 100x what you have on margin in your account. This means that with only $1000 you can control $100,000 in the market. Using a higher leverage would mean you need to put less money in your margin account.</p>

<p>Calculate True Leverage:As we mentioned before, leverage in the financial markets is the DEBT:EQUITY ratio, so we need to calculate our debt and our equity.</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>Equity = B + P where::
</span><span class='line'>E = Equity (quantity we are trying to calculate)
</span><span class='line'>B = Balance
</span><span class='line'>P = Profit on open positions (negative if open positions are in the red)</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>

</span><span class='line'>T = Trade size (in units of the base currency)
</span><span class='line'>CB = Base currency
</span><span class='line'>CA = Account currency</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Please note that the equation uses forex notation, and not true mathematical notation. In mathematical notation, EUR/USD would be displayed as USD/EUR because it denotes a ratio of &#8220;Dollars per Euro&#8221;. If you would like to use mathematical notation, currency pairs should be inverted.::</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This post describes my trading plan. It is good that this is a semi-public (semi-public in that I don&#8217;t actively advertise this site, people who come here will only come here by accident) forum. It is good because it will force me to write a good trading plan and hopefully will make me follow it.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>Beliefs</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>I believe I only need to master one setup to be a consistently profitable trader. After I have mastered one setup and &#8220;own it&#8221; I can start to master another setup &#8230; ad infinitum.</p></li>
<li><p>I believe that Price Action trading is the best approach to market analysis, because most technical analysis indicators are derivatives of price so why not just use price.</p></li>
<li><p>I believe that trading is gambling but it is possible to fix the odds slightly in your favour.</p></li>
<li><p>I don&#8217;t care what moves the Forex market, my approach is very short term. So macro economic analysis will have no impact on my trading.</p></li>
<li><p>I do need to be conscious of calendar events while I have a trade open.</p></li>
<li><p>I believe that the psychological aspect (discipline, control of fear and greed) of trading is the most important thing in trading.</p></li>
<li><p>I believe the second most important thing is money management.</p></li>
<li><p>I believe the technical aspects of trading are irrelevant if you don&#8217;t have good money management and control of your mind.</p></li>
<li><p>I do not know what the market will do. All I can do is use my experience and skills to allocate a probability to what the market will do.</p></li>
<li><p>I believe that compounding is vital.</p></li>
<li><p>I believe I can be successful at trading only if I take control of my self discipline and mind.</p></li>
<li><p>I believe losses are part and parcel of trading. Therefore losses should not upset me. Taking losses does not mean I&#8217;m a loser.</p></li>
<li><p>I believe leverage is a two edged sword, that holds the potential to bring me down.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Markets</h2>

<p>I have chosen to trade Forex. I have a couple of years experience trading equities in the USA via Contracts for Difference (CFD) But for the size of the account, I was trading, the round trip expenses were too much. So this time around I wanted a  market where I did not have to pay any transation fees on top of the spread. No transaction fees and great leverage are the reasons I chose Foreign Exchange as my preferred market to trade.</p>

<h2>Instruments</h2>

<p>My main criteria for an appropriate instrument was one with a low spread and high liquidity. Most crosses have a fairly high spread making them ineligible. Any of the major&#8217;s were going to be OK, so pretty much randomly I chose the AUDUSD, EURUSD, and GBPUSD. But will focus for at least 12 months on the AUDUSD.</p>

<h2>Broker</h2>

<p>I have two brokers <a href="http://www.fxpro.com.au">FXPro</a> and <a href="http://www.pepperstone.com.au">Pepperstone</a>. When I was hunting for a broker, my major criteria was to find a broker that had tight spreads. These two brokers should allow me to trade AUDUSD, EURUSD and GBPUSD with a 1 pip spread.</p>

<p>I have only funded FXPro at this stage, and plan to use Pepperstone as a backup. FXPro has a slight pecularity in that there are two types of accounts, one type uses the <a href="http://fxpro.com.au/trading/cfd/mt4">Market Maker</a> model and the other uses an <a href="http://fxpro.com.au/trading/cfd/ecn">ECN</a> model. I have opened an account of each type but only funded the Market Maker model account. The main difference between the two accounts are that the ECN account offers a more direct route to the interbank market, it is aimed a bigger players and commissions are charged per transaction.</p>

<h2>Platform</h2>

<p>A platforms is required for strategy development, indicator development, charting and execution. I will use <a href="http://www.r-project.org/">R</a> for strategy development and <a href="http://www.metaquotes.net/">MT4</a> for indicator development.</p>

<p>Financial considerations and a desire to keep my monthly costs down for at least 12 months precludes the option of getting a seperate data and charting package. Therefore I will utilise the broker supplied platforms for charting and execution. Currently both Pepperstone and FXPro offer <a href="http://www.metaquotes.net/">MT4</a> for their charting and execution platforms.</p>

<h2>Workflow</h2>

<h3>PreMarket</h3>

<p>TODO</p>

<h3>InMarket</h3>

<p>TODO</p>

<h3>PostMarket</h3>

<p>TODO</p>

<h2>Timeframes</h2>

<p>I&#8217;m trading a small account. Therefore to maximise the magic of compounding, I&#8217;m will trade short-term on a M15 timeframe. I do not believe I have the temperament or quickness of mind for shorter timeframes.</p>

<h2>Trading Hours</h2>

<p>Trading takes intense concentration, therefore I dont&#8217; believe I can be effective for an entire trading day. So I need to trade just a subset. There are two particular time periods that have high liquid and volatility which are the conditions best suited to create an environment in which it is possible to make some pips. The two periods are the first 3 hours of the London Open which is 0800-1100 UTC and the intersection of the London Open and the New York Open which is from 1300-1600 UTC. I will choose to trade one of these periods each day.</p>

<h2>Trading Limits</h2>

<ul>
<li>Allowed positions per day : 1</li>
</ul>


<h2>Stop Trading Signals</h2>

<ul>
<li>6% Rule</li>
<li>Outside Defined Trading Hours</li>
<li>Reached Daily Loss Limit</li>

<li>Reached Month Loss Limit</li>
<li>Emotional Drained : Tired, Depressed, Angry, Exuberant, Invincibiliy</li>

<h2>Journal</h2>

<p>I will journal all my trades on the heterodoxic.com blog under the category Execution. I will also undertake to complete a daily analysis each day prior to the London open at 0800 UTC. I have setup two Octopress templates that set out the structure and content of these journal entries. TODO</p>

<h2>Log</h2>

<p>I will log all my trades using journal.xlsx. This journal calculates position size, risk reward, risk.multiple which I will complete before executing a trade.</p>

<h2>Portfolio</h2>

<p>TODO</p>

<h2>Risk Management</h2>

<blockquote><p>equity = acctbal + open(win) - open(lose)</p></blockquote>


<h3>Capital Preservation</h3>

<ul>
<li>MaxTrade      : 5% equity</li>
<li>MaxAll        : 25% equity</li>
<li>MaxDailyLoss  : 5% equity</li>
<li>MaxWeekLoss   : 10% equity</li>
<li>MaxMonthLoss  : 20% equity</li>
<li>Never average down.</li>
<li>Miniumum R:R 2:1</li>
<li>Cut Losses</li>
<li>AdjustStops to protect 80% of profit</li>
<li>Never allow WinningTrade to become a LosingTrade</li>
</ul>


<p>I should be risking an absolute maximum of 2% of my equity on a trade. But my account is so miniscule that I feel it is necessary to risk 5%.</p>

<p>Maximum leverage 100:1, again, way too much, I should only be applying a maximum of 50:1. But the miniscule account problem rears its ugly head.</p>

<p>If my account does grow then I will institute sane money management rules, 2% of equity and 50:1 leverage.</p>

<h2>Discipline</h2>

<h3>Withdrawals</h3>

<p>This area is important because one thing I found when trading previously was, if you leave money in your account you will blow it.</p>

<p>Money earned from the markets is considered by some to be just a temporary loan, as the market will take it back. The trading analogy to a casino is strongly correlated.</p>

<p>Each time my account increases by AUD1000 I will withdraw that AUD1000. This has the beneficial side effect of giving a reward for doing well.</p>

<h2>Strategies</h2>

<p>A Trading strategies, trading setups, and trading systems are synonyms, they describe a set of rules for executing a trade. A strategy can lie somewhere on a continumn between 100% discretionary and 100% mechanical. Whether you prefer a discretionary or mechanical approach is something you will struggle with and eventually find the right mix.</p>

<p>Economic calendar events will have their own strategy section. As they are strategies. (Define strategy for specific cal. events eg. FOMC(NoTrade), OptionExpiry(NoTrade))</p>

<p>The strategies I utilise are:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://heterodoxic.com/blog/2012/04/29/strategy-alina/">Alina</a></li>
<li><a href="http://heterodoxic.com/blog/2012/04/29/strategy-ekterina/">Ekterina</a></li>
</ul>


<h2>Appendix</h2>

<h3>Naming Conventions</h3>

<p>MT4 Profiles are named according to PAIR-STRATEGYNAME. MT4 Templates are named by PAIR-TIMEFRAME-STRATEGYNAME. All timeframes use minutes so 4 Hour Timeframe is 0240 minutes or Daily timeframe is 1440 minutes etc etc. All our strategies can be found on the blog so we can always backtrack to the strategy to get naming information. For example I might see a profile called AUDUSD-ALINA or a template called AUDUSD-M1440-ALINA but its been a while so I forget what ALINA is/does, so I can just refresh my memory on the blog.</p>

    <updated>2012-01-29T23:21:00+11:00</updated>
    <id>http://mrelectron.github.com/blog/2012/01/29/how-to-write-a-film-review</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The information below is from the following two websites <a href="http://www.spiritofbaraka.com/how-to-write-a-movie-review.aspx">spiritofbaraka.com</a> &amp; <a href="http://www.moviefilmreview.com/ht">moviefilmreview.com</a>.</p>

<p>Writing a movie review is a great way of expressing your opinion of a movie.  The purpose of most movie reviews is to help the reader in determining whether they want to watch, rent or buy the movie.  The review should give enough details about the movie that the reader can make an informed decision, without giving anyway any essentials such as the plot or any surprises.  Below are our guidelines and tips for writing a good movie review.</p>

<!--more-->


<h2>Before you write a Word</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Watch the movie: The first step in writing the review is to watch the movie.  Watch the movie in a relaxed environment you are familiar with.  You do not want to be distracted by an unfamiliar room.  Watching the movie a second time will help you absorb a lot more detail about the movie.  Most movie reviewers take notes as they watch the movie review. Think about what you like and don&#8217;t like about it. Try to remember these things, because you will need them during the writing part.</p></li>
<li><p>Go home, and write down all the information that you gathered during the movie. Let all the information sit for up to a day because you need time to think over the movie. But, don&#8217;t let yourself take more than a day, because if you wait too long, you tend to lose interest and forget important things that you felt.</p></li>
<li><p>Write all the information down in a format that is readable for others. Remember to include a basic summary for people who haven&#8217;t heard of the movie, but remember to not give away the ending, or any other part that they wouldn&#8217;t want to have ruined for them.</p></li>
<li><p>Remember to aim for about 600-700 words for the entire review.</p></li>
<li><p>Hand out copies of your review to other people, so they can have the chance to read your opinion, and after time, you may start to get people wanting more and more reviews.</p></li>
<li><p>Remember to try reviewing every movie you see, because when you get into the habit, it will become easier.</p></li>
<li><p>Once you gain more confidence in your reviews, try to match the tone of each with the style of the movie. For example, a humorous writing style would work well for a comedy, whereas a more serious tone would be good for writing a drama review.</p></li>
</ul>


<h2>Writing the Review</h2>

<ol>
<li><p>Give your opinion: Most movie reviewers will give their opinion of the movie.  This is important as the reviewer can express the elements of the movie they enjoyed or disliked.  However, as in all good journalism, the reviewer should also give impartial details, and allow the reader to make their own mind over an issue the reader liked or disliked.  Opinions should be explained to allow the reader to determine whether they would agree with your opinion .
Many regular movie reviewers will develop a following.  If one can find a reviewer who shares a similar taste in films, one can confidently follow the reviewers recommendations.</p></li>
<li><p>Who is your audience?: You need to consider who your likely readers are.  Writing a movie review for children requires a different approach than if writing for a movie club.  Ensure you report on the factors that matter to your likely audience.</p></li>
<li><p>Give an outline: Give the outline of the movie, but don&#8217;t give away essential details such as the end or any surprises.  If there is a big surprise you want to entice readers by telling them something special happens, just don&#8217;t say what.</p></li>
<li><p>Actors: If the movie contains actors, as most do, detail who is starring in the movie and how well you think they acted.</p></li>
<li><p>Structure: Did the movie follow a regular predictable story line, or did it get you thinking like a Quentin Tarantino movie?</p></li>
</ol>


<p>6.Cinematography and lighting: Give details about how well the movie was shot and directed.  Was the lighting good in the moody scenes?</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Music: Did the movie have its own score like Koyaanisqatsi or ET, or did it feature songs from popular artists?</p></li>
<li><p>Read, read and read: Read and check your review thoroughly.  It can be embarrassing to find errors in your work after it has been published.  This is especially important for reviews that will be published on the Internet, as search engines are always looking for the correct spellings of key words.</p></li>
</ol>


<h2>Format</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Title of the movie</p></li>
<li><p>Paragraph 1:You will need to include the following: name of the film, prominent stars of the film, basic setting ( time and place), and type of film ( comedy, adventure, drama, etc.)</p></li>
<li><p>Paragraph 2:You will need to write a plot summary for the movie. Do not reveal the ending. Discuss at least 5 events and be sure to cover the entire scope of the movie, except the very end.</p></li>
<li><p>Paragraph 3: Discuss one aspect of filmmaking. You may choose from acting, direction, editing, costume design, set design, photography, background music, or anything else you may think of. Be sure that you are specific and cite examples from the movie.</p></li>
<li><p>Paragraph 4: Discuss another aspect of filmmaking. You may choose from acting, direction, editing, costume design, set design, photography, background music, or anything else you may think of, but obviously choose something different from what you discussed in the previous paragraph. Be sure that you are specific and cite examples from the movie.</p></li>
<li><p>Paragraph 5: Give your overall reaction to the film as well as your opinion on the quality of the film. also include your recommendations for potential viewers.</p></li>
</ul>


<h2>Example:Forrest Gump</h2>

<p>&#8220;Life is like a box of chocolates. You never know what you&#8217;re gonna get.&#8221; However, when you watch Forrest Gump starring Tom Hanks as Forrest and Robin Wright as Jenny, you know you are going to get a lot of laughs and even a few tears.</p>

<p>The screenplay for the 1994 movie was written by Eric Roth, based on the novel by Winston Groom. The story follows Forrest through 30 years of trials and tribulations, placing Forrest within historical moments of history, and in pursuit of his one dream-his &#8220;most special friend,&#8221; Jenny. According to the Washington Post, Forrest Gump won Oscar awards for Best Picture, Best Actor (Hanks), Best Director (Robert Zemeckis), Film Editing, Visual Effects and Adapted Screenplay. The movie was well deserving of these awards since the acting and the visual effects were extraordinary.</p>

<p>The films&#8217; actors success in portraying their characters is a major factor in the film&#8217;s awards. Tom Hanks and Robin Wright worked well together, just like &#8220;peas and carrots.&#8221; The on-screen chemistry between the two was phenomenal. I felt a real connection between the two, finding myself mad at Jenny when she blew Forrest off and in tears when he told her that he was heading to Vietnam. Mokui&#8217;s Movie Review states &#8220;Tom Hanks IS Forrest Gump&#8230;He breathes life into the guy and you will feel what Forrest feels&#8221; (1994, par 1).</p>

<p>James Berardinelli states, &#8220;Robin Wright gives the best performance of her career, surpassing what she accomplished in The Playboys&#8221; (1994, par2). Another performance that stands out is that of Gary Sinise. Sinise plays the part of Lieutenant Dan Taylor, whose life is saved by Forrest during the Vietnam War. James Berardinelli writes, &#8220;In this movie, his Lieutenant Dan Taylor is riveting&#8221; (1994, par 3). I thought that Sinise was quite convincing with his emotions throughout the movie, as if he was really a disabled vet who had lost both legs in the war.</p>

<p>Just as good as the actors were those working behind the scenes with the special effects. Throughout Forrest Gump the special effects were incredible. During Lieutenant Taylor&#8217;s scenes, I was convinced that he really didn&#8217;t have legs. I was studying the scenes, looking for any signs of legs, trying to figure out how it was done.</p>

<p>It turns out that each and every frame was painted over to give it the true to life values that it holds. Also bringing the movie more credibility was the ability to place Forrest in history making events. These events ranged from Forrest teaching Elvis how to swing his hips to meeting Presidents for various accomplishments. These television clips of Forrest were done with such finesse that they look real. Critic Brian Webster (2003) states, &#8220;This is handled virtually flawlessly; if you didn&#8217;t know better, you&#8217;d believe that a fellow named Gump really did tell President Lyndon Johnson that he had been shot in the rump while acting heroically in Vietnam&#8221; (par 2). Rolling Stone (2003) states, &#8220;The effects dazzle, though never at the expense of the story&#8221; (Travers, par 2).</p>

<p>This story, complete with the Oscar winning performances in both acting and special effects is perfect for those in need of a dose of goodness. My family enjoys watching Forrest Gump together for rejuvenation, to view someone with true values of honesty, friendship and family. Forrest, with his heart of gold and his low IQ, never gives up. He always looks for the best in every scenario. The movie opens with a feather floating down over the city, landing at Forrest&#8217;s feet. Near the end of the story, Forrest questions, &#8220;Do we each have a destiny - or do we just float around accidental, like on a breeze?&#8221; As you are contemplating this question, the feather reappears and floats through the countryside right up into the ending credits.</p>

    <updated>2011-12-07T20:45:00+11:00</updated>
    <id>http://mrelectron.github.com/blog/2011/12/07/carlin-religious-bullshit</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I found this 10 minute video by the late <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Carlin">George Carlin</a> on <a href="http://thepiratebay.org">Pirate Bay</a>. Its funny and great viewing for the irreligious and religious alike. The video and sound are crap but the video is still viewable.</p>

<p><video width='' height='' preload='none' controls poster=''><source src='http://heterodoxic.com/video/carlin.mp4' type='video/mp4; codecs="avc1.42E01E, mp4a.40.2"'/></video></p>

<p>I don&#8217;t know what the rest of his stuff is like. For what its worth he is 2nd on this <a href="http://www.listology.com/list/comedy-central-100-greatest-standups-all-time">list</a> of the 100 greatest standup comedians.</p>

<p>After putting this up, I found 100&#8217;s of videos of Carlin on YouTube.</p>

<p>This post uses the new HTML5 video tag, which is pretty neat, so now you can put a video on your website with the same ease as you used to be able to do with an image. I think there are some issues with cross browser support - I generally use chrome (I would much rather use Firefox - but the wheels have fallen of at Mozilla and Firefox is now just a slow bloated memory and resource hog - a crying shame.) and it works well.</p>

    <link href="http://mrelectron.github.com/blog/2011/11/18/octopress-custom-domain/"/>
    <updated>2011-11-18T17:10:00+11:00</updated>
    <id>http://mrelectron.github.com/blog/2011/11/18/octopress-custom-domain</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This post describes the process whereby you can use your own domain name to point to your blog. Useful background information can be found <a href="http://pages.github.com/">here</a>. Look under subheadings &#8220;User &amp; Organization Pages&#8221; &amp; &#8220;Custom Domains&#8221;</p>

<p>As an example of what we are going to do, my github username is mrelectron, I have a repository accessible at the internet address http://mrelectron.github.com. But I want to access this repository using a domain name that I own called heterodoxic.com</p>

<!--more-->


<h2>Assumptions</h2>

<ul>
<li>You have a working Octopress installation.</li>
<li>You own a domain name</li>
<li>You have edit / add permission for your domain name DNS records.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Step: Create CNAME file</h2>

<p>Using the editor of your choice create a file called CNAME in the source directory of your Octopress installation. On the first line put the domain name that you want to point to your Octopress installation.</p>

<p><img src="http://mrelectron.github.com/images/004.png"></p>

<h2>Step: Commit CNAME file</h2>

<p>Committing this file to the repository will signal to the github server it needs to map requests for heterodoxic.com to mrelectron.github.com</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>& git add .
</span><span class='line'>& git commit -m 'Adding CNAME file'
</span><span class='line'>& git push origin source</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h2>Step: Modify DNS Records</h2>

<p>I cannot be specific here as DNS management user interfaces are going to vary wildly. I added a single &#8220;A&#8221; DNS record that points at 207.97.227.245 which is github.com. The @ in the image is shorthand for heterodoxic.com.</p>

<p><img src="http://mrelectron.github.com/images/005.png"></p>

<h2>Step: Fini</h2>

<p>All done, it may take some time for the change made to your DNS, to propagate around the world. If it does not work after 24 hours though, you may have a problem.</p>

<h2>Assumptions</h2>

<ul>
<li>You are not logged in as root.</li>
<li>Git is installed on your computer. If not a simple sudo apt-get -y install git will suffice.</li>
<li>You have created your github account and Octopress repository, if you have not go <a href="http://heterodoxic.com/blog/2011/11/17/octopress-github/">here</a>.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Step: Get Ruby</h2>

<p>Oneiric comes with Ruby 1.8.7. Octopress depends on Ruby 1.9.2.</p>

    <id>http://mrelectron.github.com/blog/2011/11/16/did-alex-die</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you have not watched <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0111149">Shallow Grave</a> by the <a href="www.imdb.com/title/tt0117951/">Trainspotting</a> director <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000965">Danny Boyle</a> then you will not care about this question, but there are 100 responses on the <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0111149/board/threads">message board</a> about Alex&#8217;s death. I have not seen that degree of interest in any film previously, so I thought I would add my opinion.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>Naturally enough I thought to add the 101st opinion to the IMDB message board but IMDB not only want you to sign up to post a message they also want to you to submit your mobile number or credit card details. Thats beyond the pale so I have to post my opinion here where noone will read it, but thats OK.</p>

<p>First of all, I never for a moment thought he was alive and did not give the issue much thought until I read some of the messages about it, so I went back and had a look at the ending. Alex is dead! Why?</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Juliet is a doctor, she would have an excellent understanding of what it would take to kill Alex</p></li>
<li><p>Alex loses a lot of blood quite quickly. The blood on the floor does belong to Alex as David has already died. Also you can see how quickly he is bleeding out because the size of the blood pool increased rapidly.</p></li>
<li><p>Assuming the police arrived early the same morning he would have been laying there bleeding for at least 3 hours, and at the rate alluded to in point 2 he would have bled out.</p></li>
<li><p>Now even if the paramedics who were standing around were going to leave the knife in and saw (as in carpenter) around the body as some people seemed to think (that is so funny!). They would be still be physically close to him, kneeling by him, keeping him warm, offering moral support and managing his shock.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>Anyway the film is great and highly recommended. Get it, and you can make up your mind if Alex died or not.</p>
