Code blocks like those on this page are part of a scripting language called Bash. To use Bash scripts, we need to use an application that comes with Linux called Terminal.

Input

$ echo 'This is input text'This tooltip tells you what's going on.
A line that begins with the dollar sign ($) indicates a line of Bash script you need to type. To enter it, type the text that follows the $, hitting the return key at the end of each line. You can hover your mouse over each line for an explanation of what the script is doing.

Output

This is output text.
A line that does not begin with a $ is output text that is intended to give you information or tell you what to do next. We've colored output text green in these bootcamp tutorials.

User Specific Input

$ echo 'username'Outputs the text in the quotation marks.
Areas of yellow text represent your own personal info, repos, etc. If it is part of an input ($) line, you should replace your it with your own info when you type it. If it is part of output text, it is just for your reference. It will automatically show your own info in Terminal.

Good to know: There will be times when you type code, hit return, and all you are given is another prompt. Some actions that you execute in Terminal don't have any output. Don't worry, if there is ever a problem with your code, Terminal will let you know.

Good to know: For security reasons, Terminal will not display what you type when entering passwords. Just type your password and hit the return key.
