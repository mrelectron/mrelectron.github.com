TopicTypes
Personas

* People do not read help or manual, they will try and reach their objective, if they strike a problem along the way, they just want help with that particular problem and no other. 

* People intuitively know or have learned over the years that documentation is worse than useless. People intuitively know that the best way to learn is 

1. 1 to 1 
2. classroom 
3. video 
4. audio 
5. written

* practice is more important than theory.

* some information is not suitable for video/audio dissemanation. for example legislative information, parts information, product manuals. 

* so personal, classroom &  video is useful for howto documentation but written info is good for reference information such as part specifications, legislation or lets call it about or concept information. 

* we donot want sequential guided documentation except for tasks that are extremely circumscribed. 

* It appears to me that documentation is possibly driven by corporate interests (Adobe) rather than in the interests of wanting users to learn.

* A common usecase is that person (x) is wants to install and configure a piece of software (y). immediately variables come into play (vA) the software will be somewhere on a continumn of complex to simple. (vB) person (x) is familiarity and experience with software (y) is on a continumn of excellent to poor. (vC) person (x) may be extremely familiar with software (y) but ignorant of software and technology in general. (vD) person (x) may be ignorant of this software but is a technology and software guru. The only common factor is that they have a task to do, which is to install and configure the software. 

* how to handle device or software state. for example user hits a problem, what is the current state of the device or software he is using, the state will have implications for what is appropriate help. probably the best way is to undo or go back or reset device/software to a known state. 
* another issue is that software documentation is a poor cousin in the software development process. A closer integration between the developers and the documentation is required from the first minute of the project.
