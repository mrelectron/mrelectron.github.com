I found this 10 minute video by the late [George Carlin][001] on [Pirate Bay][002]. Its funny and great viewing for the irreligious and religious alike. The video and sound are crap but the video is still viewable.

I don't know what the rest of his stuff is like. For what its worth he is 2nd on this [list][003] of the 100 greatest standup comedians.

After putting this up, I found 100's of videos of Carlin on YouTube.

This post uses the new HTML5 video tag, which is pretty neat, so now you can put a video on your website with the same ease as you used to be able to do with an image. I think there are some issues with cross browser support - I generally use chrome (I would much rather use Firefox - but the wheels have fallen of at Mozilla and Firefox is now just a slow bloated memory and resource hog - a crying shame.) and it works well.
