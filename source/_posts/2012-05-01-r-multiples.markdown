This post describes R-Multiples or Risk Multiples a trading money management concept made popular by Van Tharp.

R is simply the dollar risk per trade. It's nothing but a reward-to-risk ratio. Dr. Tharp reveals the great secret of trading: The golden rule of trading is to keep losses at a level of 1 R as often as possible and to make profits that are high-R multiples.

To calculate the R Multiple for a trade:

{% blockquote %}
Rmultiple = ProfitLoss / InitialRisk
{% endblockquote %}

Example:

{% blockquote %}
InitialRisk: AUD175
ProfitLoss: AUD350
Rmultiple = 350 / 175
Rmultiple = 2.00
{% endblockquote %}

When I look at my results in terms of multiples of R I can easily tell how good or bad the trades were. I like to think of R-Multiples as telling you the efficiency of your system.

Also recording trades in terms of R-Multiples allows you to easily calculate your system's expectancy.
