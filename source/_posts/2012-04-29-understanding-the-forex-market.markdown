## What is forex?
The forex market is an over the counter (OTC) market. Unlike the stock market that requires a buyer and seller to go though a centralized exchange (i.e. The New York Stock Exchange) which will have just one price, the forex market is a decentralized market. This means currency/forex dealers can offer different prices/quotes for currency pairs resulting in better choices and deals for the buyer and seller. Foreign exchange deals are made between 2 participants; the buyer and the seller.

## Who trades Forex?
Foreign currency can be traded by almost anyone. The main players are the Banks & large financial institutions. We then have commercial traders such as hedge funds and large commercial corporations. Finally we have you and me, the retail traders.

It"s the big banks and financial institutions that have most the power and control over the price in the forex market. They will only trade between themselves and together these banks and financial institutions are known as the interbank market.

Commercial corporations often engage in international transactions and as a result have an affect and influence of exchange rates. Hedge funds and retail traders trade for the sole purpose of making money, be it though hedging, speculation and investing. These types of traders are at the bottom of the forex food chain. Retail traders especially have no influence in exchange rate prices. Larger hedge funds with substantial funds at their disposal can in certain cases have enough collateral to move or influence a currencies price.

## How to Read Quotes
Reading a foreign exchange quote is simple if you remember two things

{% blockquote %}
The first currency listed is the base currency
The value of the base currency is always 1.
{% endblockquote %}

As we know all currencies are always quoted in pairs. Every time you make a forex trade or transaction you are simultaneously buying one currency and selling another.

If you were to sell GBP/USD you would be selling the British Pound and at the same time buying the USD.

The base currency is the "head" or "lead" currency in any pair. Whenever you open a trade and buy or sell, you are always buying or selling the base currency and doing the opposite to the quote currency. Whenever you close a trade you are either buying back what you sold or selling back what you bought.

The base currency is known as the Transaction Currency, while the second currency in the pair is the Settlement Currency.   The quantity bought and sold will apply directly to the Transaction Currency, while the gains and losses from transactions will apply to the Settlement Currency.  When you buy a currency pair you are going long the Transaction Currency while simultaneously shorting the Settlement Currency.  Conversely, when you sell a currency pair you are shorting the Transaction Currency while simultaneously buying the Settlement Currency.  Since the forex market is foreign exchange, each transaction must contain one currency against another.

## Exchange Rates
For every forex pair we trade it has an exchange rate. It is the change in this exchange rate that determines how much money we make as traders. When placing a trade we are simply speculating on whether a currency will rise or fall against another. It is important to understand how exchange rates work. ::

{% blockquote %}
GBP/USD = 1.5279
{% endblockquote %}

Above we can see GBP/USD with its exchange rate quoted. The exchange rate is telling us how much we need in units of the of the quote currency (the one on the right) to buy one unit of the base currency (the one on the left).

{% blockquote %}
We would need to spend 1.5279 USD in order to buy 1 GBP.
We would need to spend 1 GBP in order to buy 1.5279 USD"s.
{% endblockquote %}

## Buying & Selling
In the forex market you can either buy or sell a currency. When buying you are expecting the base currency to rise against the quote currency and when selling you are expecting the quote currency to rise against the base currency.

BUY GBP/USD - if you were to buy the GBP/USD you expect the Pound to "gain strength" over the USD therefore pushing the exchange rate of the GBP/USD up.

SELL GBP/USD - if you were to sell the GBP/USD you expect the Pound to "weaken" against the USD therefore pushing the exchange rate of the GBP/USD down.

{% blockquote %}
"I've gone long on Cable" Translates to "I've bought the GBP/USD"
"I'm short on the Aussie" Translates to "I'm selling the AUD/USD"
{% endblockquote %}

## Pips
Price intercept points are more commonly known as PIPs. A pip is the smallest unit by which a currency quote can change. If the rate for EUR/USD is 1.3574 and it changes to 1.3575 that change is a 1 pip movement. It is these changes in forex prices that we as traders look for in order to make money from the markets. ::

{% blockquote %}
EUR/USD = 1.3574 - EUR/USD = 1.3575
You can see above the price has increased by 1 pip.
{% endblockquote %}

The pip is always the 4th number after the decimal point; however, pairs that include the Japanese yen only have 2 digits after the decimal point, in this case the pip is the 2nd number after the decimal point. For example if the rate for EUR/JPY is 132.87 and it changes to 132.88 that change is a 1 pip movement. Some brokers are now offering an extra digit at the end of their quotes which shows a fraction of a pip. ::

{% blockquote %}
EUR/USD = 1.35754
{% endblockquote %}

In the quote above the 4 is the PIP and the 5 is the pip fraction. Fractions of pips do not make too much difference to trading however it is worth keeping an eye out especially if your broker is using them in their quotes.


## Spread Bid & Ask
Just like other markets, forex quotes consist of two sides, the bid and the ask::

{% blockquote %}
The BID is the price at which you can SELL base currency.
The ASK is the price at which you can BUY base currency.
{% endblockquote %}

The prices you can sell or buy a currency are different to one and other. It is this difference in price that is known as the Spread. The spread is where the broker makes his money. Spread is usually a few pips and all brokers will offer different spreads. Obviously the lower the spread the better for us as traders so it"s a good idea to search for brokers who offer low spreads.

Spreads can fluctuate during times of high market volatility. Some brokers may offer fixed spreads. It is the trader"s personal choice as to which broker they do business with.

The bid price is the price the broker has offered if you wish to sell a currency pair. The ask price is the price the broker has offered if you wish to buy a currency pair. The difference between the bid and ask is known as the spread. ::

{% blockquote %}
Bid 	Ask
1.3486 	1.3488
{% endblockquote %}

## Lots
Forex is traded using specific amounts called Lots. A lot is the amount of units you are trading with. The standard lot size is 100,000 units. The size of the lot will determine the value per pip. Knowing the value per pip is critical in order to work out how much money you will make or lose per trade. Lots come in 4 sizes. ::

{% blockquote %}
Standard 	100,000 units
Mini 		10,000 units
Micro 		1,000 units
Nano 		100 units
{% endblockquote %}

Many brokers also have the option to trade using flexible lots, for example 1.5 standard lots (150,000 units). You can use the size of the lot to determine the value of a pip which you can use to help calculate how much you will win or lose on any particular trade. The value of a pip can be worked out using a simple formula ::

{% codeblock %}
Pip value = (.0001/exchange rate) x lot size x exchange rate
Example: EUR/USD = 1.3592, Use 1 standard lot (100,000)
Pip value = (.0001/1.3592) x 100,000 x 1.3592 = 9.999 (rounded up) = $10
{% endcodeblock %}

This means that if we were to trade the EUR/USD using 1 standard lot size, each pip will be worth $10. If we make 100 pips on our trade we will be making $1000. There is a slightly different formula used to work out the value of a pip when the USD is the base currency. The formula for this is ::

{% codeblock %}
Pip value = (0.0001/exchange rate) x lot size
Example: USD/CHF = 1.1213, Use 1 standard lot (100,000)
Pip value = (.0001/1.1213) x 100,000 = 8.918 (rounded up) = $9:
{% endcodeblock %}

This means that if we were to trade the USD/CHF using 1 standard lot each pip would be worth $9, if we make 100 pips on our trade we will be making $900.

## Leverage & Margin
New Account: Free Margin is equal to the entire account balance. If a brand new account balance is $1000,the deposit currency is USD and the broker has a minimum 1% margin requirement and the trader wants to execute a 0.3 Lot trade (assuming USD is the base currency, if it is not then the calculations are a bit more complicated), then the used margin after placing the trade can be computed by multiplying the trade size by the margin requirement (0.3 lots or $30,000 x 1% = $300).


If trading a xxxUSD pair:
{% codeblock %}
Margin = StandardLot * quote * LotSize / Leverage
Example (trading 0.5 lots of GBPUSD @ 1.3982):
Margin = 100,000 * 1.3982 * 0.5 / 200 = 349.55 USD.
{% endcodeblock %}

If trading a USDxxx pair:
{% codeblock %}
Margin = StandardLot * LotSize / Leverage
Example (trading 0.1 lots of USDJPY):
Margin = 100,000 * 0.1 / 200 = 50 USD set aside as margin (used margin).
{% endcodeblock %}

Leverage, in essence, is a loan that is provided to an investor by the broker that is handling his or her Forex account. When an investor decides to invest in the Forex market, he or she must first open up a margin account with a broker. Usually, the amount of leverage provided is either 50:1, 100:1 or 200:1, depending on the broker and the size of the position the investor is trading. Standard trading is done on 100,000 units of currency, so for a trade of this size, the leverage provided is usually 50:1 or 100:1. Leverage of 200:1 is usually used for positions of 50,000 units or less.

Although the ability to earn significant profits by using leverage is substantial, leverage can also work against investors. For example, if the currency underlying one of your trades moves in the opposite direction of what you believed would happen, leverage will greatly amplify the potential losses.

Margin is the aggregate amount of customer cash pledged against the aggregate Open Positions. The margin pledged is a function of Maximum Trading Leverage Ratio. The higher the leverage, the lower the pledged Margin. The lower the leverage, the higher the Margin needed to carry the position.

Margin - The amount of collateral a customer deposits with a broker when borrowing from the broker to buy securities. This is your account balance when you first open your account.

Leverage - The use of credit or borrowed funds to increase one's speculative capacity and increase the rate of return from an investment, as in buying securities on margin, although it can also increase the rate of loss by the same factor. Your leverage depends on the size of the trades you make relative to your account equity, and nothing else, as long as you don't surpass the maximum leverage the broker allows. This value is normally displayed as a DEBT:EQUITY ratio.

Margin requirement - expressed as a percentage, the margin requirement is set by your broker to protect itself against traders using too much leverage, or in other words, against traders borrowing more than their collateral would support according to the broker's risk management parameters. So when a broker's marketing team says their margin requirement is 1%, it means that they require 1% of your trade size in order to lend you the amount you need for the trade. For example if you are trading $100,000 position size, then the broker requires $1,000 (1%) of your margin in order to make the loan. As I stated before, this number generally does not vary unless you specifically change the deal with your broker. Furthermore, in this example we know what the margin requirement is, but we don't yet have enough information to calculate leverage, because we don't know what our account equity is (more about this later). Your broker would normally quote that as "100:1" leverage, which is not entirely accurate since our actual leverage also depends on our account equity. What they are actually saying is that your maximum leverage, based on their margin requirement, would be 100:1. How much of that leverage you actually use is entirely up to you, as long as you don't surpass this maximum.

A 100:1 leverage ratio means that your broker will lend you 100x what you have on margin in your account. This means that with only $1000 you can control $100,000 in the market. Using a higher leverage would mean you need to put less money in your margin account.

Calculate True Leverage:As we mentioned before, leverage in the financial markets is the DEBT:EQUITY ratio, so we need to calculate our debt and our equity.

{% codeblock %}
Equity = B + P where::
E = Equity (quantity we are trying to calculate)
B = Balance
P = Profit on open positions (negative if open positions are in the red)
{% endcodeblock %}


{% codeblock %}
Debt = T * Cb / Ca where::
D = Debt (the quantity we are trying to calculate)
T = Trade size (in units of the base currency)
CB = Base currency
CA = Account currency
{% endcodeblock %}

Please note that the equation uses forex notation, and not true mathematical notation. In mathematical notation, EUR/USD would be displayed as USD/EUR because it denotes a ratio of "Dollars per Euro". If you would like to use mathematical notation, currency pairs should be inverted.::

{% codeblock %}
Leverage = (T * (Ca / Cb)) / (B + P)
{% endcodeblock %}

Example
{% codeblock %}
	AccountSize: USD100,000
	TradeSize: 1 x Mini @1.2500
	T = 10,000 //Mini Lot
	Ca / Cb = 1.2500
	B = 10000
	P = 0 //no trades open so account equity == account balance
	so
	Leverage = (10000 * 1.2500) / 10000 = 1.25:1
{% endcodeblock %}
